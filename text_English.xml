  <text key="jettya" string="Dear Esther. I sometimes feel as if I’ve given birth to this island. Somewhere, between the longitude and latitude a split opened up and it beached remotely here. No matter how hard I correlate, it remains a singularity, an alpha point in my life that refuses all hypothesis. I return each time leaving fresh markers that I hope, in the full glare of my hopelessness, will have blossomed into fresh insight in the interim." />
  <text key="jettyb" string="Dear Esther. The gulls do not land here anymore; I’ve noticed that this year, they seem to shun the place. Maybe it’s the depletion of the fishing stock driving them away. Perhaps it’s me. When he first landed here, Donnelly wrote that the herds were sickly and their shepherds the lowest of the miserable classes that populate these Hebridean islands. Three hundred years later, even they have departed." />
  <text key="jettyc" string="Dear Esther. I have lost track of how long I have been here, and how many visits I have made overall. Certainly, the landmarks are now so familiar to me that I have to remind myself to actually see the forms and shapes in front of me. I could stumble blind across these rocks, the edges of these precipices, without fear of missing my step and plummeting down to sea. Besides, I have always considered that if one is to fall, it is critical to keep one’s eyes firmly open." />
  <text key="jettyd" string="Dear Esther. The morning after I was washed ashore, salt in my ears, sand in my mouth and the waves always at my ankles, I felt as though everything had conspired to this one last shipwreck. I remembered nothing but water, stones in my belly and my shoes threatening to drag me under to where only the most listless of creatures swim." />
  <text key="firstclimb" string="Donnelly reported the legend of the hermit; a holy man who sought solitude in its most pure form. Allegedly, he rowed here from the mainland in a boat without a bottom, so all the creatures of the sea could rise at night to converse with him. How disappointed he must have been with their chatter. Perhaps now, when all that haunts the ocean is the rubbish dumped from the tankers, he’d find more peace. They say he threw his arms wide in a valley on the south side and the cliff opened up to provide him shelter; they say he died of fever one hundred and sixteen years later. The shepherds left gifts for him at the mouth of the cave, but Donnelly records they never claimed to have seen him. I have visited the cave and I have left my gifts, but like them, I appear to be an unworthy subject of his solitude." />
  <text key="firstbeacha" string="At night you can see the lights sometimes from a passing tanker or trawler. From up on the cliffs they are mundane, but down here they fugue into ambiguity. For instance, I cannot readily tell if they belong above or below the waves. The distinction now seems banal; why not everything and all at once! There’s nothing better to do here than indulge in contradictions, whilst waiting for the fabric of life to unravel." />
  <text key="firstbeachb" string="There was once talk of a wind farm out here, away from the rage and the intolerance of the masses. The sea, they said, is too rough for the turbines to stand: they clearly never came here to experience the becalming for themselves. Personally, I would have supported it; turbines would be a fitting contemporary refuge for a hermit: the revolution and the permanence." />
  <text key="firstbeachc" string="When you were born, you mother told me, a hush fell over the delivery room. A great red birthmark covered the left side of your face. No one knew what to say, so you cried to fill the vacuum. I always admired you for that; that you cried to fill whatever vacuum you found. I began to manufacture vacuums, just to enable you to deploy your talent. The birthmark faded by the time you were six, and had gone completely by the time we met, but your fascination with the empty, and its cure, remained." />
  <text key="firstbeachd" string="Those islands in the distance, I am sure, are nothing more than relics of another time, sleeping giants, somnambulist gods laid down for a final dreaming. I wash the sand from my lips and grip my wrist ever more tightly, my shaking arms will not support my fading diaries." />
  <text key="cliffpatha" string="Reading Donnelly by the weak afternoon sunlight. He landed on the south side of the island, followed the path to the bay and climbed the mount. He did not find the caves and he did not chart the north side. I think this is why his understanding of the island is flawed, incomplete. He stood on the mount and only wondered momentarily how to descend. But then, he didn’t have my reasons." />
  <text key="cliffpathb" string="Donnelly’s book had not been taken out from the library since 1974. I decided it would never be missed as I slipped it under my coat and avoided the librarian’s gaze on the way out. If the subject matter is obscure, the writer’s literary style is even more so, it is not the text of a stable or trustworthy reporter. Perhaps it is fitting that my only companion in these last days should be a stolen book written by a dying man." />
  <text key="cliffpathc" string="The mount is clearly the focal point of this landscape; it almost appears so well placed as to be artificial. I find myself easily slipping into the delusional state of ascribing purpose, deliberate motive to everything here. Was this island formed during the moment of impact; when we were torn loose from our moorings and the seatbelts cut motorway lanes into our chests and shoulders, did it first break surface then?" />
  <text key="cliffpathd" string="A wonderful sight. The moon cresting the junction between the cliff path and the stone circle. It cast a shadow of the ridge across the beach, all the world as if you had signed your name across the sand in untidy handwriting." />
  <text key="whitelines" string="When someone had died or was dying or was so ill they gave up what little hope they could sacrifice, they cut parallel lines into the cliff, exposing the white chalk beneath. You could see them from the mainland or the fishing boats and know to send aid or impose a cordon of protection, and wait a generation until whatever pestilence stalked the cliff paths died along with its hosts. My lines are just for this: to keep any would-be rescuers at bay. The infection is not simply of the flesh." />
  <text key="valleytopa" string="They were godfearing people those shepherds. There was no love in the relationship. Donnelly tells me that they had one bible that was passed around in strict rotation. It was stolen by a visiting monk in 1776, two years before the island was abandoned altogether. In the interim, I wonder, did they assign chapter and verse to the stones and grasses, marking the geography with a superimposed significance; that they could actually walk the bible and inhabit its contradictions?" />
  <text key="valleytopb" string="We are not like Lot’s wife, you and I; we feel no particular need to turn back. There’s nothing to be seen if we did. No tired old man parting the cliffs with his arms; no gifts or bibles laid out on the sand for the taking. No tides turning or the shrieking gulls overhead. The bones of the hermit are no longer laid out for the taking: I have stolen them away to the guts of this island where the passages all run to black and there we can light each others faces by their strange luminescence." />
  <text key="valleytopc" string="I quote directly: “A motley lot with little to recommend them. I have now spent three days in their company that is, I fear, enough for any man not born amongst them. Despite their tedious inclination to quote scripture, they seem to me the most godforsaken of all the inhabitants of the outer isles. Indeed, in this case, the very gravity of that term – forsaken by god – seems to find its very apex.” It appears to me that Donnelly too found those who wander this shoreline to be adrift from any chance of redemption. Did he include himself in that, I wonder?" />
  <text key="paul" string="Dear Esther. I met Paul. I made my own little pilgrimage. My Damascus a small semi-detached on the outskirts of Wolverhampton. We drank coffee in his kitchen and tried to connect to one another. Although he knew I hadn’t come in search of an apology, reason or retribution, he still spiralled in panic, thrown high and lucid by his own dented bonnet. Responsibility had made him old; like us, he had already passed beyond any conceivable boundary of life." />
  <text key="hermita" string="I threw my arms wide and the cliff opened out before me, making this rough home. I transferred my belongings from the bothy on the mount and tried to live here instead. It was cold at night and the sea lapped at the entrance at high tide. To climb the peak, I must first venture even deeper into the veins of the island, where the signals are blocked altogether. Only then will I understand them, when I stand on the summit and they flow into me, uncorrupted." />
  <text key="hermitb" string="I would leave you presents, outside your retreat, in this interim space between cliff and beach. I would leave you loaves and fishes, but the fish stocks have been depleted and I have run out of bread. I would row you back to your homeland in a bottomless boat but I fear we would both be driven mad by the chatter of the sea creatures." />
  <text key="hermitc" string="I find myself increasingly unable to find that point where the hermit ends and Paul and I begin. We are woven into a sodden blanket, stuffed into the bottom of a boat to stop the leak and hold back the ocean. My neck aches from staring up at the aerial; it mirrors the dull throb in my gut where I am sure I have begun to form another stone. In my dreams, it forms into a perfect representation of Lot’s wife, head over her shoulder, staring along the motorway at the approaching traffic, in a vacuum of fatalistic calm." />
  <text key="hermitd" string="This hermit, this seer, this distant historian of bones and old bread, where did he vanish to? Why, asked the farmers, why asked Jakobson, why bother with your visions at all, if you are just to throw your arms up at the cliff and let it close in behind you, seal you into the belly of the island, a museum shut to all but the most devoted." />
  <text key="valleyreturnc" string="He still maintains he wasn’t drunk but tired. I can’t make the judgement or the distinction anymore. I was drunk when I landed here, and tired too. I walked up the cliff path in near darkness and camped in the bay where the trawler lies beached. It was only at dawn that I saw the bothy and decided to make my temporary lodgings there. I was expecting just the aerial and a transmitter stashed in a weatherproof box somewhere on the mount. It had an air of uneasy permanence to it, like all the other buildings here; erosion seems to have evaded it completely." />
  <text key="valleyreturnb" string="The vegetation here has fossilized from the roots up. To think they once grazed animals here, the remnants of occupation being evidence to that. It is all sick to death: the water is too polluted for the fish, the sky is too thin for the birds and the soil is cut with the bones of hermits and shepherds. I have heard it said that human ashes make great fertilizer, that we could sow a great forest from all that is left of your hips and ribcage, with enough left over to thicken the air and repopulate the bay." />
  <text key="valleyreturna" string="I dreamt I stood in the centre of the sun and the solar radiation cooked my heart from the inside. My teeth will curl and my fingernails fall off into my pockets like loose change. If I could stomach, I’d eat, but all I seem capable of is saltwater. Were the livestock still here, I could turn feral and gorge. I’m as emaciated as a body on a slab, opened up for a premature source of death. I’ve rowed to this island in a heart without a bottom; all the bacteria of my gut rising up to sing to me." />
  <text key="valleyreturnd" string="I have become convinced I am not alone here, even though I am equally sure it is simply a delusion brought upon by circumstance. I do not, for instance, remember where I found the candles, or why I took it upon myself to light such a strange pathway. Perhaps it is only for those who are bound to follow." />
  <text key="entry" string="Dear Esther. I have now driven the stretch of the M5 between Exeter and Bristol over twenty-one times, but although I have all the reports and all the witnesses and have cross-referenced them within a millimetre using my ordnance survey maps, I simply cannot find the location. You’d think there would be marks, to serve as some evidence. It's somewhere between the turn off for Sandford and the Welcome Break services. But although I can always see it in my rear view mirror, I have as yet been unable to pull ashore." />
  <text key="secondbeacha" string="Dear Esther. This will be my last letter. Do they pile up even now on the doormat of our empty house? Why do I still post them home to you? Perhaps I can imagine myself picking them up on the return I will not make, to find you waiting with daytime television and all its comforts. They must form a pile four feet high now, my own little ziggurat; a megalith of foolscap and manila. They will fossilise over the centuries to follow; an uneasy time capsule from a lost island. Postmarked Oban: it must have been sent during the final ascent." />
  <text key="secondbeachb" string="Dear Esther. I have found myself to be as featureless as this ocean, as shallow and unoccupied as this bay, a listless wreck without identification. My rocks are these bones and a careful fence to keep the precipice at bay. Shot through me caves, my forehead a mount, this aerial will transmit into me so. All over exposed, the nervous system, where Donnelly’s boots and yours and mine still trample. I will carry a torch for you; I will leave it at the foot of my headstone. You will need it for the tunnels that carry me under." />
  <text key="secondbeachc" string="Dear Esther. Whilst they catalogued the damage, I found myself afraid you’d suddenly sit up, stretch, and fail to recognise me, I orbited you like a sullen comet, our history trailing behind me in the solar wind from the fluorescent tubes. Your hair had not been brushed yet, your make-up not reapplied. You were all the world like a beach to me, laid out for investigation, your geography telling one story, but hinting at the geology hidden behind the cuts and bruises." />
  <text key="secondbeachd" string="I have found the ship’s manifest, crumpled and waterlogged, under a stash of paint cans. It tells me that along with this present cargo, there was a large quantity of antacid yoghurt, bound for the European market. It must have washed out to sea, God knows there are no longer gulls or goats here to eat it." />
  <text key="boat" string="There must be a hole in the bottom of the boat. How else could new hermits have arrived?" />
  <text key="buoya" string="It’s only at night that this place makes any sluggish effort at life. You can see the buoy and the aerial. I’ve been taking to sleeping through the day in an attempt to resurrect myself. I can feel the last days drawing upon me – there’s little point now in continuation. There must be something new to find here – some nook or some cranny that offers a perspective worth clinging to. I’ve burnt my bridges; I have sunk my boats and watched them go to water." />
  <text key="buoyb" string="All night the buoy has kept me lucid. I sat, when I was at the very edge of despair, when I thought I would never unlock the secret of the island, I sat at the edge and I watched the idiot buoy blink through the night. He is mute and he is retarded and he has no thought in his metal head but to blink each wave and each minute aside until the morning comes and renders him blind as well as deaf-mute. In many ways, we have much in common." />
  <text key="buoyc" string="I’ve begun to wonder if Donnelly’s voyage here was as prosaic as it was presented. How disappointed not to have found the bones of the holy man! No wonder he hated the inhabitants so. To him, they must have seemed like barnacles mindlessly clinging to a mercy seat. Why cling so hard to the rock? Because it is the only thing that stops us from sliding into the ocean. Into oblivion." />
  <text key="buoyd" string="An imagined answerphone message. The tires are flat, the wheel spins loosely, and the brake fluid has run like ink over this map, staining the landmarks and rendering the coastline mute, compromised. Where you saw galaxies, I only saw bruises, cut into the cliff by my lack of sobriety." />
  <text key="wrecka" string="I don’t know the name of the wreck in the bay; it seems to have been here for several years but has not yet subsided. I don’t know if anyone was killed; if so, I certainly haven’t seen them myself. Perhaps when the helicopter came to lift them home, their ascent scared the birds away. I shall search for eggs along the north shore, for any evidence that life is marking this place out as its own again. Perhaps it is us that keeps them at bay." />
  <text key="wreckb" string="I remember running through the sands of Cromer; there was none of the shipwreck I find here. I have spent days cataloguing the garbage that washes ashore here and I have begun to assemble a collection in the deepest recess I could find. What a strange museum it would make. And what of the corpse of its curator? Shall I find a glass coffin and pretend to make snow white of us both?" />
  <text key="wreckc" string="Why is the sea so becalmed? It beckons you to walk upon its surface; but I know all too well how it would shatter under my feet and drag me under. The rocks here have withstood centuries of storms and now, robbed of the tides, they stand muted and lame, temples without cause. One day, I will attempt to climb them, hunt among their peaks for the eggs, the nests, that the gulls have clearly abandoned" />
  <text key="lowervalley1" string="I had kidney stones, and you visited me in the hospital. After the operation, when I was still half submerged in anaesthetic, your outline and your speech both blurred. Now my stones have grown into an island and made their escape and you have been rendered opaque by the car of a drunk." />
  <text key="lowervalley02a" string="I have begun my ascent on the green slope of the western side. I have looked deep into the mountain from the shaft and understood that I must go up and then find a way under. I will stash the last vestiges of my civilisation in the stone walls and work deeper from there. I am drawn by the aerial and the cliff edge: there is some form of rebirth waiting for me there." />
  <text key="lowervalley02b" string="I have begun my ascent on the windless slope of the western side. The setting sun was an inflamed eye squeezing shut against the light shone in by the doctors. My neck is aching through constantly craning my head up to track the light of the aerial. I must look downwards, follow the path under the island to a new beginning." />
  <text key="lowervalley02c" string="I have begun to climb, away from the sea and towards the centre. It is a straight line to the summit, where the evening begins to coil around the aerial and squeeze the signals into early silence. The bothy squats against the mount to avoid the gaze of the aerial; I too will creep under the island like an animal and approach it from the northern shore." />
  <text key="shafta" string="When I first looked into the shaft, I swear I felt the stones in my stomach shift in recognition." />
  <text key="shaftb" string="What charnel house lies at the foot of this abyss? How many dead shepherds could fill this hole?" />
  <text key="shaftc" string="Is this what Paul saw through his windscreen? Not Lot’s wife, looking over her shoulder, but a scar in the hillside, falling away to black, forever." />
  <text key="goatsheda" string="When they graze their animals here, Donnelly writes, it is always raining. There’s no evidence of that rain has been here recently. The foliage is all static, like a radio signal returning from another star." />
  <text key="goatshedb" string="In the hold of the wrecked trawler I have found what must amount to several tons of gloss paint. Perhaps they were importing it. Instead, I will put it to use, and decorate this island in the icons and symbols of our disaster." />
  <text key="goatshedc" string="Cromer in the rain; a school trip. We took shelter en masse in a bus stop, herded in like cattle, the teachers dull shepherds. The sand in my pocket becoming damper by the second." />
  <text key="uppervalley" string="The bothy was constructed originally in the early 1700s. By then, shepherding had formalised into a career. The first habitual shepherd was a man called Jakobson, from a lineage of migratory Scandinavians. He was not considered a man of breeding by the mainlanders. He came here every summer whilst building the bothy, hoping, eventually, that becoming a man of property would secure him a wife and a lineage. Donnelly records that it did not work: he caught some disease from his malcontented goats and died two years after completing it. There was no one to carve white lines into the cliff for him either." />
  <text key="bothya" string="Inventory: a trestle table we spread wallpaper on in our first home. A folding chair; I laughed at you for bringing camping in the lakes. I was uncomfortable later and you laughed then. This diary; the bed with the broken springs – once asleep, you have to remember not to dream. A change of clothes. Donnelly’s book, stolen from Edinburgh library on the way here. I will burn them all on the last morning and make an aerial of my own." />
  <text key="bothyb" string="When the oil lamps ran out I didn’t pick up a torch but used the moonlight to read by. When I have pulled the last shreds of sense from it, I will throw Donnelly’s book from the cliffs and perhaps myself with it. Maybe it will wash back up through the caves and erupt from the spring when the rain comes, making its return to the hermit's cave. Perhaps it will be back on the table when I wake. I think I may have thrown it into the sea several times before." />
  <text key="bothyc" string="Three cormorants seen at dusk; they did not land. This house, built of stone, built by a long-dead shepherd. Contents: my camp-bed, a stove, a table, chairs. My clothes, my books. The caves that score out the belly of this island, leaving it famished. My limbs and belly, famished. This skin, these organs, this failing eyesight. When the battery runs out in my torch, I will descend into the caves and follow only the phosphorescence home." />
  <text key="bothyd" string="My heart is landfill, these false dawns waking into whilst it is still never light. I sweat for you in the small hours and wrap my blankets into a mass. I have always heard the waves break on these lost shores, always the gulls forgotten. I can lift this bottle to my ear, and all there ever is for me is this Hebridean music." />
  <text key="toppatha" string="In a footnote, the editor comments that at this point, Donnelly was going insane as syphilis tore through his system like a drunk driver. He is not to be trusted – many of his claims are unsubstantiated and although he does paint a colourful picture, much of what he says may have been derived directly from his fever. But I have been here and I know, as Donnelly did, that this place is always half-imagined. Even the rocks and caves will shimmer and blur, with the right eyes." />
  <text key="toppathb" string="He left his body to the medical school and was duly opened out for a crowd of students twenty-one days after his passing. The report is included in my edition of his book. The syphilis had torn through his guts like a drunk driver, scrambling his organs like eggs on a plate. But enough definition remained for a cursory examination and, as I suspected, they found clear evidence of kidney stones. He is likely to have spent the last years of his life in considerable pain: perhaps this is the root of his laudanum habit. Although its use makes him an unreliable witness, I find myself increasingly drawn into his orbit." />
  <text key="toppathc" string="What to make of Donnelly? The laudanum and the syphilis? It is clearly not how he began, but I have been unable to discover if the former was a result of his visiting the island or the force that drove him here. For the syphilis, a drunk driver smashing his insides into a pulp as he stumbled these paths, I can only offer my empathy. We are all victims of our age. My disease is the internal combustion engine and the cheap fermentation of yeast." />
  <text key="toppathd" string="Jakobson’s ribcage, they told Donnelly, was deformed, the result of some birth defect or perhaps a traumatic injury as a child. Brittle and overblown it was, and desperately light. Perhaps it was this that finally did for him, unable to contain the shattering of his heart. In half-light, his skeleton a discarded prop, a false and calcified seabird." />
  <text key="middlepatha" string="They found Jakobson in early spring, the thaw had only just come. Even though he’d been dead nearly seven months, his body had been frozen right down to the nerves and had not even begun to decompose. He’d struggled halfway down the cliff path, perhaps looking for some lost goat, or perhaps in a delirium and expired, curled into a claw, right under the winter moon. Even the animals shunned his corpse; the mainlanders thought to bring it home unlucky. Donnelly claims they dragged it to the caves to thaw out and rot, but he is proving an unreliable witness." />
  <text key="middlepathb" string="They found Jakobson in early spring, the thaw had only just come. Even though he’d been dead nearly seven months, his body had been frozen right down to the nerves and had not even begun to decompose. His fingernails were raw and bitten to the quick; they found the phosphorescent moss that grows in the caves deep under the nails. Whatever he’d been doing under the island when his strength began to fail is lost. He’d struggled halfway up the cliff again, perhaps in a delirium, perhaps trying to reach the bothy’s fire, before curling into a stone and expiring." />
  <text key="middlepathc" string="They found Jakobson in early spring, the thaw had only just come. Even though he’d been dead nearly seven months, his body had been frozen right down to the nerves and had not even begun to decompose. All around him, small flowers were reaching for the weak sun, the goats had adjusted happily to life without a shepherd and were grazing freely about the valley. Donnelly reports they hurled the body in fear and disgust down the shaft, but I cannot corroborate this story." />
  <text key="thirdbeacha" string="I will become a torch for you, an aerial. I will fall from the sky like ancient radio waves of flawed concrete. Through underground springs and freezing subterranean rivers. Through the bacteria of my gut and heart. Through the bottomless boat and forgotten trawlers where nobody has died. Like the hermit and Lot’s wife, I will fossilise and open a hole in the rock to admit me through." />
  <text key="thirdbeachb" string="To explore here is to become passive, to internalise the journey and not to attempt to break the confines. Since I burnt my boats and contracted my sickness, this has become easier for me. It will take a number of expeditions to traverse this microcontinent; it will take the death of a million neurons, a cornucopia of prime numbers, countless service stations and bypasses to arrive at the point of final departure." />
  <text key="thirdbeachc" string="This beach is no place to end a life. Jakobson understood that, so did Donnelly. Jakobson made it halfway back up the cliff. Donnelly lost faith and went home to die. I have the benefit of history, of progress. Someone has erected an aerial to guide me through these black waves, a beacon that shines through the rocks like phosphorescent moss." />
  <text key="cavesentrance" string="Climbing down to the caves I slipped and fell and have injured my leg. I think the femur is broken. It is clearly infected: the skin has turned a bright, tight pink and the pain is crashing in on waves, winter tides against my shoreline, drowning out the ache of my stones. I struggled back to the bothy to rest, but it has become clear that there is only one way this is likely to end. The medical supplies I looted from the trawler have suddenly found their purpose: they will keep me lucid for my final ascent." />
  <text key="tunnela" string="From here, this last time, I have understood there is no turning back. The torch is failing along with my resolve. I can hear the singing of the sea creatures from the passages above me and they are promising the return of the gulls." />
  <text key="tunnelb" string="Did Jakobson crawl this far? Can I identify the scratches his nails ruined into the rocks? Am I following him cell for cell, inch for inch? Why did he turn back on himself and not carry through to the ascent?" />
  <text key="tunnelc" string="Donnelly did not pass through the caves. From here on in, his guidance, unreliable as it is, is gone from me. I understand now that it is between the two of us, and whatever correspondence can be drawn from the wet rocks." />
  <text key="tunneld" string="Donnelly’s addiction is my one true constant. Even though I wake in false dawns and find the landscape changed, flowing inconstantly through my tears, I know his reaching is always upon me." />
  <text key="deepcavea" string="I first saw him sat by the side of the road. I was waiting for you to be cut out of the wreckage. The car looked like it had been dropped from a great height. The guts of the engine spilled over the tarmac. Like water underground." />
  <text key="deepcaveb" string="They had stopped the traffic back as far as the Sandford junction and come up the hard shoulder like radio signals from another star. It took twenty-one minutes for them to arrive. I watched Paul time it, to the second, on his watch." />
  <text key="deepcavec" string="It was as if someone had taken the car and shaken it like a cocktail. The glove compartment had been opened and emptied with the ashtrays and the boot; it made for a crumpled museum, a shattered exhibition." />
  <text key="deepcaved" string="There is no other direction, no other exit from this motorway. Speeding past this junction, I saw you waiting at the roadside, a one last drink in your trembled hands." />
  <text key="rivera" string="I’m traversing my own death throes. The infection in my leg is an oilrig that dredges black muck up from deep inside my bones. I swallow fistfuls of diazepam and paracetamol to stay conscious. The pain flows through me like an underground sea." />
  <text key="riverb" string="If the caves are my guts, this must be the place where the stones are first formed. The bacteria phosphoresce and rise, singing, through the tunnels. Everything here is bound by the rise and fall like a tide. Perhaps, the whole island is actually underwater." />
  <text key="riverc" string="I am travelling through my own body, following the line of infection from the shattered femur towards the heart. I swallow fistfuls of painkillers to stay lucid. In my delirium, I see the twin lights of the moon and the aerial, shining to me through the rocks." />
  <text key="riverd" string="In my final dream, I sat at peace with Jakobson and watched the moon over the Sandford junction, goats grazing on the hard shoulder, a world gone to weed and redemption. He showed me his fever scars, and I mine, between each shoulder the nascency of flight." />
  <text key="chimneya" string="When I was coming round from the operation, I remember the light they shone in my eyes to check for pupil contraction. It was like staring up at a moonlit sky from the bottom of a well. People moved at the summit but I could not tell if you were one of them." />
  <text key="chimneyb" string="This cannot be the shaft they threw the goats into. It cannot be the landfill where the parts of your life that would not burn ended up. It cannot be the chimney that delivered you to the skies. It cannot be the place where you rained back down again to fertilise the soil and make small flowers in the rocks." />
  <text key="chimneyc" string="I will hold the hand you offer to me; from the summit down to this well, into the dark waters where the small flowers creep for the sun. Headlights are reflected in your retinas, moonlit in the shadow of the crematorium chimney." />
  <text key="chimneyd" string="This is a drowned man’s face reflected in the moonlit waters. It can only be a dead shepherd who has come to drunk drive you home." />
  <text key="emergencea" string="The moon over the Sandford junction, headlights in your retinas. Donnelly drove a grey hatchback without a bottom, all the creatures of the tarmac rose to sing to him. All manner of symbols crudely scrawled across the cliff face of my unrest. My life reduced to an electrical diagram. All my gulls have taken flight; they will no longer roost on these outcrops. The lure of the moon over the Sandford junction is too strong." />
  <text key="emergenceb" string="I sat here and watched two jets carve parallel white lines into the sky. They charted their course and I followed them for twenty-one minutes until they turned off near Sandford and were lost. If I were a gull, I would abandon my nest and join them. I would starve my brain of oxygen and suffer delusions of transcendence. I would tear the bottom from my boat and sail across the motorways until I reached this island once again." />
  <text key="emergencec" string="I wish I could have known Donnelly in this place – we would have had so much to debate. Did he paint these stones, or did I? Who left the pots in the hut by the jetty? Who formed the museum under the sea? Who fell silently to his death, into the frozen waters? Who erected this godforsaken aerial in the first place? Did this whole island rise to the surface of my stomach, forcing the gulls to take flight?" />
  <text key="rocksa" string="Of fire and soil, I chose fire. It seemed the more contemporary of the options, the more sanitary. I could not bear the thought of the reassembly of such a ruins. Stitching arm to shoulder and femur to hip, charting a line of thread like traffic stilled on a motorway. Making it all acceptable for tearful aunts and traumatised uncles flown in specially for the occasion. Reduce to ash, mix with water, make a phosphorescent paint for these rocks and ceilings." />
  <text key="rocksb" string="We shall begin to assemble our own version of the north shore. We will scrawl in dead languages and electrical diagrams and hide them away for future theologians to muse and mumble over. We will send a letter to Esther Donnelly and demand her answer. We will mix the paint with ashes and tarmac and the glow from our infections. We paint a moon over the Sandford junction and blue lights falling like stars along the hard shoulder." />
  <text key="rocksc" string="I returned home with a pocket full of stolen ash. Half of it fell out of my coat and vanished into the car’s upholstery. But the rest I carefully stowed away in a box I kept in a drawer by the side of my bed. It was never intended as a meaningful act but over the years it became a kind of talisman. I’d sit still, quite still, for hours just holding the diminishing powder in my palm and noting its smoothness. In time, we will all be worn down into granules, washed into the sea and dispersed." />
  <text key="rocksd" string="Dear Esther. I find each step harder and heavier. I drag Donnelly’s corpse on my back across these rocks, and all I hear are his whispers of guilt, his reminders, his burnt letters, his neatly folded clothes. He tells me I was not drunk at all." />
  <text key="lostbeach" string="From here I can see my armada. I collected all the letters I’d ever meant to send to you, if I’d have ever made it to the mainland but had instead collected at the bottom of my rucksack, and I spread them out along the lost beach. Then I took each and every one and I folded them into boats. I folded you into the creases and then, as the sun was setting, I set the fleet to sail. Shattered into twenty-one pieces, I consigned you to the Atlantic, and I sat here until I’d watched all of you sink." />
  <text key="paul2a" string="There were chemical diagrams on the mug he gave me coffee in; sticky at the handle where his hands shook. He worked for a pharmaceutical company with an office based on the outskirts of Wolverhampton. He’d been travelling back from a sales conference in Exeter: forming a strategic vision for the peddling of antacid yoghurt to the European market. You could trace the connections with your finger, join the dots and whole new compounds would be summoned into activity." />
  <text key="paul2b" string="There were chemical diagrams on the posters on the walls on the waiting room. It seemed appropriate at the time; still-life abstractions of the processes which had already begun to break down your nerves and your muscles in the next room. I cram diazepam as I once crammed for chemistry examinations. I am revising my options for a long and happy life." />
  <text key="paul2c" string="There were chemical stains on the tarmac: the leak of air conditioning, brake fluid and petrol. He kept sniffing at his fingers as he sat by the roadside waiting as if he couldn’t quite understand or recognise their smell. He said he’d been travelling back from a sales conference in Exeter; he’d stopped for farewell drinks earlier, but had kept a careful eye on his intake. You could hear the sirens above the idling traffic." />
  <text key="paul2d" string="Paul, by the roadside, by the exit for Damascus, all ticking and cooled, all feathers and remorse, all of these signals routed like traffic through the circuit diagrams of our guts, those badly written boats torn bottomless in the swells, washing us forever ashore." />
  <text key="northpatha" string="When Paul keeled over dead on the road to Damascus, they resuscitated him by hitting him in the chest with stones gathered by the roadside. He was lifeless for twenty-one minutes, certainly long enough for the oxygen levels in his brain to have decreased and caused hallucinations and delusions of transcendence. I am running out of painkillers and the moon has become almost unbearably bright." />
  <text key="northpathb" string="The pain in my leg sent me blind for a few minutes as I struggled up the cliff path: I swallowed another handful of painkillers and now I feel almost lucid. The island around me has retreated to a hazed distance, whilst the moon appears to have descended into my palm to guide me. I can see a thick black line of infection reaching for my heart from the waistband of my trousers. Through the fugue, it is all the world like the path I have cut from the lowlands towards the aerial." />
  <text key="northpathc" string="I will drag my leg behind me; I will drag it like a crumpled hatchback, tyres blown and sparking across the dimming lights of my vision. I am running out of painkillers and am following the flicker of the moon home. When Paul keeled over dead on the road to Damascus, they restarted his heart with the jump leads from a crumpled hatchback; it took twenty-one attempts to convince it to wake up." />
  <text key="northpathd" string="A sound of torn metal, teeth running over the edge of the rocks, a moon that casts a signal. As I lay pinned beside you, the ticking of the cooling engine, and the calling from a great height, all my mind as a bypass." />
  <text key="overlook" string="I’ve begun my voyage in a paper boat without a bottom; I will fly to the moon in it. I have been folded along a crease in time, a weakness in the sheet of life. Now, you’ve settled on the opposite side of the paper to me; I can see your traces in the ink that soaks through the fibre, the pulped vegetation. When we become waterlogged, and the cage disintegrates, we will intermingle. When this paper aeroplane leaves the cliff edge, and carves parallel vapour trails in the dark, we will come together." />
  <text key="channel" string="If only Donnelly had experienced this, he would have realised he was his own shoreline, as am I. Just as I am becoming this island, so he became his syphilis, retreating into the burning synapses, the stones, the infection." />
  <text key="ascent1a" string="Returning to my car afterwards, hands still shaking and a head split open by the impact. Goodbye to tearful aunts and traumatised uncles, goodbye to the phenomenal, goodbye to the tangible, goodbye Wolverhampton, goodbye Sandford, goodbye Cromer, goodbye Damascus. This cliff path is slippery in the dew; it is hard to climb with such an infection. I must carve out the bad flesh and sling it from the aerial. I must become infused with the very air." />
  <text key="ascent1b" string="There are headlights reflected in these retinas, too long in the tunnels of my island without a bottom. The sea creatures have risen to the surface, but the gulls are not here to carry them back to their nests. I have become fixed: open and staring, an eye turned on itself. I have become an infected leg, whose tracking lines form a perfect map of the junctions of the M5. I will take the exit at mid-thigh and plummet to my Esther." />
  <text key="ascent1c" string="The stones in my stomach will weigh me down and ensure my descent is true and straight. I will break through the fog of these godforsaken pills and achieve clarity. All my functions are clogged, all my veins are choked. If my leg doesn’t rot off before I reach the summit, it will be a miracle. There are twenty-one connections in the circuit diagram of the anti-lock brakes, there are twenty-one species of gull inhabiting these islands , it is twenty-one miles between the Sandford junction and the turn off for home. All these things cannot, will not, be a co-incidence." />
  <text key="ascent1d" string="Bent back like a nail, like a hangnail, like a drowning man clung onto the wheel, drunk and spiraled, washed onto the lost shore under a moon as fractured as a shattered wing. We cleave, we are flight and suspended, these wretched painkillers, this form inconstant. I will take flight. I will take flight." />
  <text key="ascent2a" string="He was not drunk Esther, he was not drunk at all. He had not drunk with Donnelly or spat Jakobson back at the sea; he had not careered across the lost shores and terminal beaches of this nascent archipelago. He did not intend his bonnet to be crumpled like a spent tissue by the impact. His windscreen was not star-studded all over like a map of the heavens. His paintwork etched with circuit diagrams, strange fish to call the gulls away. The phosphorescence of the skid marks lighting the M5 all the way from Exeter to Damascus." />
  <text key="ascent2b" string="Blind with panic, deaf with the roar of the caged traffic, heart stopped on the road to Damascus, Paul, sat at the roadside hunched up like a gull, like a bloody gull. As useless and as doomed as a syphilitic cartographer, a dying goatherd, an infected leg, a kidney stone blocking the traffic bound for Sandford and Exeter. He was not drunk Esther, he was not drunk at all; all his roads and his tunnels and his paths led inevitably to this moment of impact. This is not a recorded natural condition: he should not be sat there with his chemicals and his circuit diagrams, he should not be sat there at all." />
  <text key="ascent2c" string="I have dredged these waters for the bones of the hermit, for the traces of Donnelly, for any sign of Jakobson’s flock, for the empty bottle that would incriminate him. I have scoured this stretch of motorway twenty-one times attempting to recreate his trajectory, the point when his heart stopped dead and all he saw was the moon over the Sandford junction. He was not drunk Esther, he was not drunk at all, and it was not his fault, it was the converging lines that doomed him. This is not a recorded natural condition, the gulls do not fly so low over the motorway and cause him to swerve. The paint scored away from his car in lines, like an infection, making directly for the heart." />
  <text key="ascent2d" string="A gull perched on a spent bonnet, sideways, whilst the sirens fell through the middle distance and the metal moaned in grief about us. I am about this night in walking, old bread and gull bones, old Donnelly at the bar gripping his drink, old Esther walking with our children, old Paul, as ever, old Paul he shakes and he shivers and he turns off his lights alone." />
  <text key="summita" string="I have run out of places to climb. I will abandon this body and take to the air." />
  <text key="summitb" string="We will leave twin vapour trails in the air, white lines etched into these rocks." />
  <text key="summitc" string="I am the aerial. In my passing, I will send news to each and every star." />
  <text key="ascension" string="Dear Esther. I have burnt my belongings, my books, this death certificate. Mine will be written all across this island. Who was Jakobson, who remembers him? Donnelly has written of him, but who was Donnelly, who remembers him? I have painted, carved, hewn, scored into this space all that I could draw from him. There will be another to these shores to remember me. I will rise from the ocean like an island without bottom, come together like a stone, become an aerial, a beacon that they will not forget you. We have always been drawn here: one day the gulls will return and nest in our bones and our history. I will look to my left and see Esther Donnelly, flying beside me. I will look to my right and see Paul Jakobson, flying beside me. They will leave white lines carved into the air to reach the mainland, where help will be sent." />
  <text key="ascension2" string="Dear Esther. I have burned the cliffs of Damascus, I have drunk deep of it. My heart is my leg and a black line etched on the paper all along this boat without a bottom. You are all the world like a nest to me, in which eggs unbroken form like fossils, come together, shatter and send small black flowers to the very air. From this infection, hope. From this island, flight. From this grief, love." />
  <text key="comebackloud" string="Come back!" />
  <text key="comebackwhisper" string="Come back..." />
  <text key="1" string="Dan: Hello everyone! I'm Dan Pinchbeck and I'm the Creative Director of The Chinese Room and this is the &lt;i&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/i&gt; developers' commentary.&#xA;Rob: Hi, I'm Rob Briscoe and I'm the Artist on &lt;i&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/i&gt;.&#xA;Jess: And I'm Jessica Curry and I was the Composer on the game.&#xA;Dan: So, what you're looking at today is a remake, of a remake, of a mod. &lt;i&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/i&gt; started off in 2007 as a &lt;i&gt;Half-Life 2&lt;/i&gt; mod, that did really really well in the modding community, which was fantastic, and as a result of that attracted the attention of Rob, who worked as the primary developer on a Source remake of the game that was released in 2012, and this year is another remake where it has been updated for a cross-platform release, and we wanted to add in this developer's commentary just to give you a bit more of an insight into some of the ideas behind the game as it came together." />
  <text key="2" string="Rob: So, you'll see around you in a lot of the environments, there's a lot of detail engrained into everything. One of the things I wanted to do with &lt;i&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/i&gt; is bring the visuals up to the same kind of level of detail that Dan and Jess had put into the other areas of the game. So, all of the history and the hidden pieces of story that intertwine with the VO's and the music, and stuff, I wanted to bring some of that into the environments. So, if you look around you, you'll see there's a lot of interesting bits and pieces; a piece of paper with someone's name on it, a photograph, an ultrasound. All of these little bits and pieces I kind of laid in to just bring in another aspect of the story into the game. Also, they are actually randomised so, every time you play, you will see something different lying around. This is just to build on this idea that everyone has a unique experience and a unique interpretation of the story." />
  <text key="3" string="Dan: Part of the point of the whole game, I think, was this idea that rather than having a linear, straight-through version of the story, that we could have multiple story units for each place you were, and I was really interested in this idea of how you can open up that space that people can interpret. So I loved the idea that you could have had two people who could have played this game and then would have a conversation about it, and one of them would say &quot;oh, what did you think about when this happened?&quot; and the other person would be like &quot;well, that didn't happen for me; I had a completely different event happen or a completely different story happen&quot;. It kind of feels very game-y in that way actually. One of the things I love about writing for games is that you hand over so much control to the player that it becomes their story and that's really, really important rather than trying to force them. So, using randomised blocks of voice-over in the game, and the kind of randomised prop details that Rob was talking about means that it gives it a really different feeling every time you go through. That was really interesting for me because I like the idea of going &quot;well, not everyone has to have the same experience&quot;; and because it's interactive, you have the capacity to have very different experiences occupying the same space. So yeah, but balancing all that becomes an absolute nightmare.&#xA;Rob: I think it's nice though, because everybody gets a personal experience. I love reading the forums and seeing how people come and they sort of tell their story and what they interpreted of it, and you see other people discussing what they thought of it and to me it's kind of nice because everybody takes something unique away from it." />
  <text key="4" string="Dan: So people have asked why &lt;i&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/i&gt; is set on a Hebridean Island. What's really interesting about this is it's one of those times when your kind of aspirations as an artist and the practical realities kind of dovetail, we knew that we had to have some way of limiting the player from disappearing off the play space, and when we made the original it was a mod, and because it was a &lt;i&gt;Half Life 2&lt;/i&gt; mod, you kind of had an Eastern European city, spaceship or blasted, desolate landscape; we had three options if you didn't want to start making any other assets. So it started off with these practical constraints; we don't want to set it on a spaceship, we don't want to set it in an Eastern European city, so it's got to be on this desolate landscape, and we want to limit the player so an island seems like a natural choice. And it's really interesting how you start from that and we had this big lump of clay on the table that we were carving out paths and things and annoying the cleaners, and Jess and I were talking and Jess started making snippets of music to go in there. And then all of a sudden, we just went &quot;oh that's the story, oh that's what happened here&quot;, but it really started, I think, from the place and when we started looking at photographs of Boreray, we started going... and reading some of the history behind it, suddenly that was it, and it really naturally became &quot;this is the place, this is what happened here, this is how it feels&quot;, and then everything else coalesced around that.&#xA;Rob: Yeah, as an artist, it made my job a lot easier because those islands are so kind of, like, the environment is kind of hostile; you're out there in the Hebrides, you got this kind of inclement weather, you've got cold, rain, snow. It's a very, kind of, it can be a very depressing place to be at times, but it's also at the same time, very beautiful, and it's this stark bare landscape that has these beautiful surroundings. So it's, in terms of art, I think it really helped me to portray a lot of the themes in &lt;i&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/i&gt;.&#xA;Dan: And there was a natural fit with the music as well. It suggested a musical style that was really key, I think.&#xA;" />
  <text key="5" string="Jess: When I wrote the music for the mod of &lt;i&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/i&gt;, there was absolutely no budget whatsoever for live players, so all the music was sampled, but one of the good things about that is actually it forced me to be quite creative about how I wrote the music so, with my background in sound art, I wanted to use samples in a different way that wasn't just using it to sound like a violin, I wanted to time stretch and manipulate samples to make something different and strange and quite unique, but then when we got the Indie Fund money, I had the amazing opportunity to re-record the music with live players, and that was so exciting for me, actually, because that's where it comes to life. And I thought long and hard about whether to write new music, going from the mod to the commercial version, but actually I decided that my initial and original emotional response to the game was probably going to be the strongest response and reaction that I had, so I just literally... the music that I had written for samples I then wrote out for live instruments, but what they bring to it is transformative, actually, and I think the beach is a really good example of this, where you had these awful samples soaring away and then you have this string quartet playing this very bleak, very sparse music and they bring the presence of the island immediately to it and it comes to life and that's the exciting thing. It wasn't a huge budget, but just having the experience of working with the players was just magical." />
  <text key="6" string="Dan: This symbol on the beach, which is the golden ratio is… it's one of the only things that was really left explicitly from the mod. In the original mod, there was an awful lot of, more kind of, symbols and kind of, much more kind of, mystical and magical element to the island, there was a lot of very weird stuff in there. A lot of them came out of the commercial version because they felt like they were a little bit explicit, and instead there's a lot more hidden kind of code and symbols in there. There's still some stuff which you can only actually see or experience if you are not playing the game and you're looking at it from an editor. We had in the original mod things like trees planted to mirror the shape of the M5 or there's a whole bunch of things that are there to represent star clusters or all kinds of things like that. And we'll probably talk a bit more about the hidden details and secrets in the game as we go through, but that was really interesting for us in terms of the design of it, of going, you've got this kind of conscious, explicit player experience; games are always constantly manipulating your mood and your feelings and the decisions you're making. And so, really trying to, create a space that had all of these kinds of subliminals in it was a really interesting thing that we wanted to do, both with the original and now; I think it got lifted up into a much more sophisticated version when we went to the commercial because Rob's out to bring that sort of level of artistry to the visuals that's really got this sense of hidden meaning in there, and that was important given how complex and symbol-heavy and poetic this story is where a lot of it doesn't actually make any sense, but it's about kind of leaving you with this half-life of ideas and thoughts that you can't quite shake to stay with you. So we really were trying to get that blend of how music and story and visuals could all create that really uncanny structure that you wouldn't necessarily be able to define properly, but you knew it had a kind of meaning that was staying with you." />
  <text key="7" string="Rob: So something I wanted to do as an artist was create some kind of reward for the player when they explore the island. There are some areas of the game where it's a little bit more... quieter; there's no music or there's no voiceovers, so I kind of wanted to create a bit of an incentive for people to explore, and you'll find around the island these random, scattered items that are usually slightly out of place from the environment themselves, but in another aspect, they actually bring a little bit of story to the island itself; usually to the island or to the actual protagonist or the characters that surround it. So you'll find around the island these little props and stuff, just keep your eye out for it if you're exploring." />
  <text key="8" string="Dan: Alright, let's talk about walking. Let's do it - we're going to address the elephant in the room, the very, very slow moving elephant in the room, so this might be a longer conversation because it kind of fits with that. So Esther was the first of what are now called 'walking simulators', and it was really interesting that, for us, it didn't feel that weird to have a game that was slower than normal where, actually, there was lots of time to walk around and think and look at things, and it was amazing at the time how this was seen as completely revolutionary and it's really interesting. It's amazing to see how many other games have kind of, like, taken it on board. For me, it was... it came from... I didn't see it as being odd to have a game where very little happened where you thought about what you were doing. For me, it was kind of interesting that you could play... some of the best moments of &lt;i&gt;Doom&lt;/i&gt; are the bits where nothing's happening, or &lt;i&gt;System Shock&lt;/i&gt; or those games that I absolutely love. Those quiet moments were the really powerful ones, but &lt;i&gt;Esther&lt;/i&gt; is definitely slower than a lot of games and I think that's actually why it's lasted. I think if we had... we did have moments where we went &quot;should it be faster? Should we put a sprint button in?&quot; but I'm so pleased we held our nerve and went &quot;no, just as like in real life, I don't run everywhere because that would be weird.&quot; It's OK to have a game where you don't run everywhere and actually it is a bit weird to run everywhere, but if you're gonna do that, then you've got to support it in other ways, and I think the music was a really powerful way of supporting that change of pace.&#xA;Jess: What's really funny for me though, Dan, is that shamefully I'd never played a game before I worked on &lt;i&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/i&gt;, so I didn't realise that all games weren't like this which is, now looking back, really naive. But I didn't realise that games didn't have, you know, always have this slow pace and that there were lots of meditative games out there and that actually wasn't really the case at the time, and that's exploded since. Um, but in terms of the music, supporting that pace that you'd set emotionally felt really important, so if you listen to the music, actually the BPM is a really slow walking speed. And it just almost, I mean there's a lot of things now that say, it's called entrainment in that it slows your heartbeat or it can speed up your heartbeat when you listen to music and actually I think what the &lt;i&gt;Esther&lt;/i&gt; music does really successfully is that it makes you almost accept, and more than accept, that that speed you actually start to feel that's the pace of your journey, and I really like that about the music actually.&#xA;Rob: It just, yeah, it makes you just comfortable with that pace, too. I think it just eases you into it." />
  <text key="9" string="Dan: Everything about &lt;i&gt;Esther&lt;/i&gt;, for me, is a dream; that the landscape is not an island, it's the dream of an island, and the music is like music that you wake up because you heard it in your sleep, but you're not conscious of hearing it. And the language in the story was supposed to be like that as well. It didn't matter the sense it made, it was more about the kind of shapes it created, if that makes sense, so that the words were kind of... were like being in water... like listening to something underwater, it'd be this very dreamlike, symbolic, poetic thing. It always frustrated me in games with game writing, this has really changed quite a lot, there was never enough space for poetic languages; it was very 'exposition-y', very descriptive, very direct. And you have art and audio that have amazing creative spaces that they could explore, but when it came down to actually writing, you just had to basically &quot;go into the room, describe the character, tell the player what to do&quot;, it just seemed like the most boring thing you could do with words in a game. And why couldn't a writer have the same artistic freedom as a visual artist or an audio designer or a musician in terms of being able to say &quot;isn't this just about creating this kind of emotional tone... this emotional space.&quot; And it's really, I still love that about the game, it's one of the things I love so much about Nigel's voiceovers is that it has this really odd disconnected dreamlike quality to it, where you might finish the game and not actually understand anything that happened, but you're being carried along in the flow of it. And without any kind of sarcasm at all - I get into trouble for saying things like this - the same design principle applies as this to &lt;i&gt;Halo&lt;/i&gt;, it's 30 seconds of fun... or 30 seconds of depressing engagement, I guess, in our case, but it is about that loop of being in the moment in the game constantly and that's actually the critical thing that matters." />
  <text key="10" string="Jess: One of the things you are always trying to do as a composer is create memorable themes, and a slight confession is that probably the most memorable theme, which is 'Remember' in &lt;i&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/i&gt; wasn't actually created for the game... Rob is looking shocked!&#xA;Rob: ... What? (both laugh)&#xA;Jess: So it was actually from a piece of choral music that I had written years before, based on a Christina Rossetti poem called &lt;i&gt;Remember&lt;/i&gt; and one of the things I was talking about earlier was how I didn't have any budget. So I had this piece of choral music and I thought 'hang on! this absolutely perfect for &lt;i&gt;Esther&lt;/i&gt;, but I don't want to use all of it', so the only bit that you actually get in the game is the first line of the choral piece of music. But that actually went on to form the main theme of the music that I wrote. And I think for me it's really interesting how things that you have written earlier, years before, sometimes come in really, really useful and fit. So, I always tell people and students not to despair if something doesn't get used or doesn't work at the time, because actually there'll come a place or a time when you think &quot;hang on a minute I've got something that fits.&quot; So in terms of that memorable theme, the &lt;i&gt;Remember&lt;/i&gt; theme gets used in a multitude of different ways during the game and one of the things it does is helps you to identify the kind of psychic place that you're in, in the game. So the theme is played in lots of different ways and, actually, you'll notice that as you go through the game it becomes more and more broken and more and more manipulated, and broken down, as the player goes through the journey and as you're psychologically struggling to get to the end point in the game. So music is really, really useful for highlighting the psychological mood, and we talk a lot about psychogeography, which always sounds a bit &quot;uuh-ooh&quot;; a bit pretentious, but actually I think it's really important to what the three of us did in the game.&#xA;Dan: Yeah, absolutely. Like the core kind of idea about psychogeography, is the place you're in is not the place you're in, or you create the place you're in, it's not just this 'you're here and the landscape is out there', but you don't navigate like a city by street signs and by this kind of form of things; you navigate it by the things which are significant to you in the way that you've lived in that space. I think that was really kind of key to... I think it's really central to how the fusion of art and story and music come together in &lt;i&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/i&gt;, because it's not a place where we're going &quot;right, we have to lead the player up here because it's a natural formation, and then you would naturally have a piece of music here because you come around a corner&quot;, but the story, music and art all work around the idea of what is going on inside the narrator's head at this point. How do we represent his emotional state, relative to this landscape? And again, it's that idea of the game is a dream of a place, it's like the idea of it being a fever dream or a coma dream, which obviously ties in a lot with the story, and we can come back to in a lot more detail when we get to the caves a bit later on." />
  <text key="11" string="Dan: White lines. &#xA;Rob: Yeah.&#xA;Dan: They actually did this. It was really cool. I found this historical document. They used to do this on Boreray and the Hebrides that if a disease broke out, they'd actually chip out and expose the chalk so, if you're on a boat and you're coming to the island, you'd know not to land because it was infectious, which is the coolest... it's one of those things where you go...  it's almost impossible as a writer to come up with something as cool as that! It just has to be something that was actually done, and it's so sad as well and I love this bit and the fact that we can do it, because it feels really real because it references a real thing and, I don't know, there's something real special about that but... it was always one of those bits in the game that I thought &quot;we've got to be able to represent this somehow, we have to be able to get these things in here&quot;. &#xA;Rob: Yeah, that's really interesting, I actually didn't know that was actually based historically and in... real life. That's really cool. My thing about the white lines is that it was kind of... it was this completely surreal thing but also it was kind of... it just added to the landscape, it was like, &quot;whoa, what was hell is that?&quot; And putting that into the game was kinda challenging because, to me, it just seemed like this is... it's gonna be really hard to pull off in a way that's kind of realistic but then, when you look at the kind of art style in the game, it's not really a realistic thing. Like, everything is half-imagined so you've... in that way, it really fit in the landscape and it kinda creates this amazing landmark that you see in the environment and I just find it really interesting to hear about that.&#xA;Dan: I think it's one of those things where... it's not a realistic place. No game is a realistic place anyway, but as long as you're understanding that you're making something which isn't real and you have that kind of capacity to be... sort of to explore it artistically, and we'll come back and talk about it not being realistic in a little while, but that's really, really important because then you can say it's what it's about, what these things represent or how they make you feel as a player, not about going &quot;is this accurate?&quot; And I get really inspired by doing a lot of research into history and things like that with all of our games because you can find those things that speak to you. It's amazing that you can find that in an 18th century book and go &quot;that really speaks to me now. That has meaning now.&quot; That's fascinating, I think." />
  <text key="12a" string="Rob: Something that I wanted to bring through in the art of the game was the same kind of fidelity that you find in both Jessica's music and Dan's writing, in the same kind of way that you have all of these little details is very… close attention to detail that kind of really bring richness to the story, and something that was missing in the original mod version was this lack of a visual layer of story, and something that I did throughout the art of the game is to add in all these details here and there, little bits of story, little links to certain things that you may or may not hear or see. Just a layer of richness in the world and give you some kind of reward for exploring, so keep your eye out as you look around." />
  <text key="13" string="Dan: There's a scene in &lt;i&gt;Donnie Darko&lt;/i&gt;, where Drew Barrymore's playing this English teacher, and she talks about 'cellar door' as being the most beautiful word in the English language, that is the sound of the words together. And &quot;&lt;i&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/i&gt;&quot; actually comes from the introduction to the Faith No More song &lt;i&gt;The Crab Song&lt;/i&gt; on their first album 'Introduce Yourself', and there's a point where, I think it's Chuck at that point who is the vocalist before Mike Patton, and just says &quot;Dear Esther&quot; and it really lodged with me because the sound &quot;Dear Esther&quot; has a really amazing sound to it and I think, when we started making it, and the idea of it being these series of letters to someone came through, just came straight back out of going &quot;that's just a really beautiful-sounding combination of words&quot;. And I think that really sums up the whole approach to the writing in &lt;i&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/i&gt; of &quot;what's the most beautiful combination of words and images we can put together?&quot; and to do it that way rather than writing a traditional plot as such. So yeah, &lt;i&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/i&gt;: Faith No More and &lt;i&gt;Doom&lt;/i&gt;. That's where it comes from." />
  <text key="14" string="Dan: I think the central question to the entire experience for most people that've played it or are talking about it is this idea of &quot;is the island real? Is what's going on a literal event of a man walking across a Scottish island, or is it a dream that he's had - does the island even exist?&quot; And one of the things we tried to do with the writing is to constantly lull the player into a position where they got an understanding, they made a decision about what they thought was going on, and then to undercut it, so you never actually were able to settle on any one interpretation. And that was the challenge I set myself when I wrote the original mod was &quot;can we put a story in a game that, not only lends itself to multiple interpretations but there is no stable interpretation?&quot; Every single interpretation you have will always have questions and you'll never fully be able to trust what you think you understand about the game, so it's challenging I think for that result and becomes quite a challenging game story because of that, because you don't ever get that situation to go &quot;I understand it now, I can walk away from this thing and it's closed off and it's tidy&quot;. It was a very deliberate attempt to say &quot;no matter where you think you are with this story, you're always questioning whether or not that's right.&quot;" />
  <text key="15" string="Jess: One of the things that's been most commented on with the audio and the music in &lt;i&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/i&gt; is how sparse it is, and that was a really deliberate tactic. I wanted to leave room for the player to think, and to dream, and to wonder, and to put their own interpretation into what was happening. And I think the problem with so much modern media is how bombarded we are constantly, it's the kind of MTV flash-in-your-face constant music, and Dan and I watch a lot of drama together and there really is constant music.&#xA;Dan: Endless. Which is constantly telling you what you should feel REALLY CLEARLY and it's like being beaten up by the music sometimes.&#xA;Jess: And when you read a lot reviews of &lt;i&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/i&gt;, a lot of people say they had this time to think and to interpret, and that was one of their favourite things; that they place themselves so directly into the game and it's THEIR experience, and I think that's actually the greatest success of the game on all points from the story to Rob's art to the music as we all left space for the player to dream." />
  <text key="16" string="Rob: So there's a lot of places in the game where you see a lot of strange things, and this was very deliberate. One of the things we wanted to do was, like, not spoon feed the player every little piece of story; some things are literally just in there to let you think and let you decide on whatever you want to bring to the story yourself. I approached it like an impressionist painting where you have this vague outline of things, but if you stare at it enough you can kind of fill in the spaces and the image comes together on its own, so a lot of these strange pieces of geography and stuff, that's really kind of deliberate in some ways, just to keep the player's mind open and kind of bring their own interpretation of the story through that." />
  <text key="17" string="Jess: When I was originally thinking about how to write the music for the game, I suddenly realised that you don't see anybody in the game, and the most important character, as such, is the island itself. So one of the things that I did with the music was to write the island as if she or he were a character in its own right and that's really important, I think, that you're going through this space and, actually, it's completely devoid of people, but the music in a way populates the island, and the voice of the island speaks to you through the music.&#xA;Dan: Which is interesting, 'cos I think that's really come on in terms of later games we've done, that that sowed the seeds for the ways in which we approached the music in &lt;i&gt;Rapture&lt;/i&gt;, where it was very specifically the voice of characters and &lt;i&gt;Machine for Pigs&lt;/i&gt; as well, where the music was about being Lily's voice in the game and Lily's representation in the game, so it's interesting how, looking back on &lt;i&gt;Esther&lt;/i&gt;, a lot of those ideas were tried out here and then came on to take other forms in stuff we've done since." />
  <text key="18" string="Dan: The radio mast in &lt;i&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/i&gt; is obviously… there is a really important design feature as well as its place within the story. And that I think it came from, it's really interesting it being a &lt;i&gt;Half-Life&lt;/i&gt; mod to begin with and the citadel in &lt;i&gt;Half-Life 2&lt;/i&gt;, that it tells you how far you are through the game; you're always looking up to the skyline – &quot;Am I closer to the citadel? Can I see it?&quot; - And it lets you know how near you are to the end of the game, and it's really important because &lt;i&gt;Esther&lt;/i&gt;'s so open in a way and because there isn't this... you're not using kind of shoot-outs or kind of gating it with combat encounters to kind of constantly keep you moving; that it was really, really important that you always have that focal point of going &quot;I know exactly from the beginning of the game, virtually right from the start, you know where you're going, you know where the game's going to end up and you know that sooner or later you're going to be... you're at the base of that thing or climbing that thing and it's always there - that red light.&quot; And I think, particularly with the colour palette of the game, the fact that you've got this very, very, very clear red light unlike any other colours in the game immediately tells you, as the player, THIS is what the shape of this thing is going to be, THIS is where I'm going, THIS gives me a purpose even if the sort of moment by moment is a bit more abstract.&#xA;Rob: Yeah, and navigationally as well it helps you... it draws you in the right direction as you play the game. You can never get lost if you follow that one landmark.&#xA;Dan: Yeah, I think it's a really interesting place of where that sort of traditional game design is still... there's loads of it in &lt;i&gt;Esther&lt;/i&gt;, it's just not necessarily done in quite the same way." />
  <text key="19" string="Rob: So something you'll notice as you look around the environment is, you know, from a distance you see the landscape - it's kind of a beautiful place in some ways. But something I wanted to bring to the game is that there's this second layer beneath the surface, whereas if you look at things closely, you'll see the actual island itself is very polluted, it's kind of very rotten, everywhere you look, every rock, every grass, surface, it has this layer of filth on it and it's been put in there to kind of emphasise further that this island is a really unpleasant place to live. It's like, if you scratch the surface, you'll see how corrupt this island is." />
  <text key="20" string="Dan: We cast and did all the voice direction for &lt;i&gt;Esther&lt;/i&gt; ourselves for the mod and it was basically Jess and I on a casting website, just listening to peoples' showreels and finding what's the voice of this thing, and it was… there was never any question about Nigel, I think, we heard his showreel for the first time round, it was... we'd probably been listening to about 30 or 40 actors and we started listening to his showreel and both looked at each and went &quot;that's it. That's him.&quot; And it was amazing when Nigel came in, we had, I think, a day and a half to do the whole thing, and he just did that amazing thing that really, really great actors did - he just walked in, got in front of the microphone, and more or less did the entire thing in one take. And we did hardly any retakes on anything, it just felt like his instinct for the character and the game were so strong that he just, without virtually any direction, just came in and just got it, and one of the hardest things with the voiceover that we did was, when we went from the mod which had 3 potential narrative units per cue to 4 potential narrative units per cue, was not only finding new bits of writing that kind of complements and played off what was already there in the original mod but for Nigel to come back in, what, nearly 5 years later and to just re-find that voice in exactly the same way and deliver it in a way that fitted and complemented it, it was a testament to his abilities as an actor, I think, that apart from the... we had spent quite a lot of time trying to make the sound actually sound the same in terms of mic placement and things like that, but in terms of the actual delivery of those new monologues, you wouldn't know that that was both written and acted, like, 4 and a half years after the original thing was done, so the one person who's not in the room today deserves a huge amount of credit for how the... the game was kind of eventually delivered but also in terms of how the game has lasted - a huge amount of respect needs to go to Nigel Carrington for his work on it." />
  <text key="21" string="Rob: So this hole in the ground was kind of a difficult thing in some ways, it's a bit of a challenging aspect to the game 'cos in some ways, it's kind of like, for me, we wanted to have this... this pit here… I wanted the player to be able to actually go as close as possible and look over the edge and have this feeling of dread and stuff, but the other issue that we faced was, like, what would happen if the player just jumped into the hole, we have no real death in the game, and from a design point of view, Dan, I don't know what you...&#xA;Dan: It's really hard because, you know, it was a game where we couldn't let the player die, we didn't want to have respawns, but we had to handle the fact that there would be both accidents where the player would fall off a cliff or something, but also the deliberate urges of player - the first thing you're going to do is &quot;great, there's an ocean, how far out can I go?&quot; or &quot;there's a cliff that's really high, can I jump off it?&quot; and how do you have death in a game where you can't have the player die because if the player starts breaking up the experience by dying and reloading, then you're in a really... you start breaking the experience a lot, so...&#xA;Rob: Yeah, we didn't want to also have artificial boundaries, you know, where...&#xA;Dan: Yeah.&#xA;Rob: Like an invisible wall. Like if you take a look through the game, you'll never see a place where you think you can get to but you can't. There's always some kind of actual, natural boundary or man-made boundary, so yeah, that was the other thing - we didn't want to create this invisible wall around this thing, so...&#xA;Dan: It kind of... the hole drove the way in which that sort of the very weird audio visual.... probably the most dreamlike bits in the game where if you do die and you get the kind of the heartbeat and the strange flashes of visuals, and I think in a lot of ways if we hadn't had the hole there and we hadn't had a place where we go &quot;right, players will jump in this hole. We have to start from that basis, they will throw themselves down this hole&quot;, it kind of gave us the impetus to really, really focus on it and I think the stuff like drowning deaths and cliff deaths are strong because the hole was there, and I'm not sure if the hole hadn't been there whether or not we'd have arrived at that way of handling it, which I'm really proud of. I think it's a really, incredibly creative and interesting way of handling a player going out of bounds and actually being able to reset the game when the player's basically done something you ideally wouldn't want them to do.&#xA;Rob: Yeah, I kinda think it fits well with the theme and the game as well because you don't really know what just happened.&#xA;Dan: Yeah, absolutely.&#xA;Rob: It's not like... it's not like you hear a death sound and then you kind of respawn. It's this, kind of, like, very soft, very ambiguous change.&#xA;Dan: There was a point in the original mod where if you die, it would do the whole &lt;i&gt;Half-Life&lt;/i&gt; 'major fracture detected', it was a really good tone to the game." />
  <text key="22" string="Jess: One of the really important jobs of a composer, I think, is to provide the player or the listener with different emotional tones and states, and up until this point in the game, this music has been very sparse, very intimate and very isolating in a way, but the island is also a beautiful and magnificent place, and what I wanted to do at this point for the first time in the game is to create something that was really epic. So we go from that shift in scale, where it's very intimate and small, to suddenly realising that this is an extraordinary and magical place to be, as well as a difficult and quite sad and melancholic place to be, so the string players were instructed at this point to play with much more vibrato; up until this point, they've played in a very Scottish style, actually - no vibrato, very plain playing. But this was a really beautiful cue to write actually because it has that scale, you suddenly realise that the island is really big and.... you had this beautiful vista and the music then shifts so the player can actually, just for a moment, enjoy being where they are.&#xA;Rob: I think that's a.... can I come in?&#xA;(Everyone laughs)&#xA;Rob: Yeah, I was going to say this is actually one of my favourite parts of the game. It's just where everything, all the elements come together perfectly. You've got the music which is just epic, as Jess has said; you've got the landscape, which is like this big open space; um, you've got all the little bits and pieces I put into the detail of the environment, like the movement, there's leaves blowing around, there's the clouds in the sky, there's the mist rising off of the grass, and then you've got Dan's voiceover coming in there, and I think it's like all of these elements coming together and in perfect synergy. It really brings.... uh, chills up your spine." />
  <text key="23" string="Dan: We should probably talk about some of the inspirations behind it. I'm on a strict &quot;you don't talk about &lt;i&gt;STALKER&lt;/i&gt;&quot; kind of a…&#xA;Jess/Rob: Aww. (laugh)&#xA;Dan: And when Rob and I started talking, I think one of the first things that we kind of discovered was how much we're both obsessed with &lt;i&gt;STALKER&lt;/i&gt;. And I think that's one of the major things behind it, in terms of when people talk about game inspiration. For me, there's a lot of FPS stuff in there - &lt;i&gt;Doom&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;System Shock&lt;/i&gt;, but I think &lt;i&gt;STALKER&lt;/i&gt; probably more than anything else, and &lt;i&gt;Roadside Picnic&lt;/i&gt;, the Strugatsky novel that &lt;i&gt;STALKER&lt;/i&gt;'s based on, of the idea that this incredible space that you didn't understand that's simultaneously beautiful and threatening... And I think Tarkovsky's films kind of play into that as well, particularly his version of &lt;i&gt;STALKER&lt;/i&gt;, that you want to have this place that you feel rather than think about and, for me, that was kind of core to all of the inspirations for the game as this is a space that is about feeling, not thinking.&#xA;Rob: The movies in particular. I hadn't watched the movies. I'd read the book and I played the game and when I watched the movie, it kind of all made sense to me, like, why I like the game so much and why I like the story. It's just, like, every shot is like a painting, it's like every shot has its own story to tell. There's very little dialogue in the actual movie itself, it's just these long lingering shots, and each shot is amazingly beautiful and is kind of desolation. And for me, that was a huge influence, like, trying to bring some of that through into the environments, so that is definitely something that I struggle not to talk about. But the game as well, I'd say the game... the actual &lt;i&gt;STALKER&lt;/i&gt; game has a big place in my heart gaming-wise, it's one of the reasons I got into game art in the first place. So that, to me, is a big part of it too." />
  <text key="24" string="Dan: Inside the bothy, there is a randomised chance that you can find an ultrasound picture on the table and I think it's the one instance of randomisation in the game that is like the pinnacle of it, because the idea that Esther was pregnant when she died changes everything emotionally. It's about how you understand the story. I'm not saying you don't care as much if you don't find it, but it just adds this other layer of just... the ground falls away. The first time I saw it and the meaning of the crash and Esther's death just means so much more when you go &quot;it's not just about her, there was an unborn child here&quot;, and I think that's where the randomisation just hits its absolute peak because it's one tiny detail that may or may not be there, but if it's there, it's going to fundamentally change the way you feel about the entire thing, and that's the strength that the randomisation elements in &lt;i&gt;Esther&lt;/i&gt; kinda provide that you go... your likely feeling about the story and your understanding about the story can be changed so absolutely by the occurrence or not of one tiny little prop detail, and that's something which... those moments, I think, are what make it really, really special, so for me it's almost like the most important prop in the game, because when it happens, it's so profound.&#xA;Rob: Yeah, and it's... again, it's something that makes each playthrough more personal, I think, and this is what I love reading about, y'know, people finding these things and going &quot;holy shit. I've just found this one thing that's going to change my interpretation completely&quot;.&#xA;Dan: Yeah, absolutely." />
  <text key="25" string="Dan: So, as you leave the bothy and the seagull takes off, that's the one jump scare in the game, which is kind of interesting because when we made it, we kinda had to… we kinda called it a ghost story but there was no intention really; we wanted this kind of dreamy, hallucinatory type thing. But when it came out, people started coming back and saying &quot;this game's absolutely terrifying. I was really frightened&quot;, and that was really amazing and I think that's because nothing happens. We're so trained in games to go... there's stimulus all the time, but if nothing happens, you're waiting for something to happen and kind of... I tend to go back to again and again to the whole sequence in &lt;i&gt;Dead Space 2&lt;/i&gt; when you go back to the Ishimura and it's like the best bit of &lt;i&gt;Dead Space 2&lt;/i&gt;, because what feels like hours, but is probably only about 15 minutes, nothing happens and no Necromorph comes at you and it's absolutely terrifying because there's just this space and you're just left in it. So the kind of the bird here is really interesting, because it can actually really, really make you jump, but I don't know if that was part of why people were saying that the game was really scary but it's a real surprise when people started coming back and saying &quot;this is a frightening game&quot;. And I don't know how much of that is to do with the ideas in the game are frightening when you think about them, and how much of it is to do with the emptiness and the lack of things in the game make it a really quite stressful or quite frightening place, but it's a real surprise, I think, that sort of reaction from a lot of players when we shipped it." />
  <text key="26" string="Rob: So one of the things that influenced the visuals quite a lot was the tech limitations at the time, and also the themes of the game. Tech-wise, we were never ever gonna achieve photorealism and I think that's a good thing. I mean, really it made us stretch out into other areas and, for me as an artist, it made me think a little bit more creatively. I did a few tests at the beginning and when I realised this wasn't possible, I kinda went back and I did some research on different styles, and one of the ones that really struck me was this kind of impressionistic painterly style where it's kind of like... there's just enough shape and colour there for you to form an image, but a lot of it is your imagination, the believability of the environment is in your mind. So this is something I wanted to bring over into the game and you'll see a lot of landscapes that look very surreal, very unreal and that's mainly due to this impressionistic style." />
  <text key="27" string="Rob: One of the more interesting and challenging things to do in the visual side of things is to create an emotional connection with the player. With the music, it's very strong and the dialogue can help you to feel what the characters are feeling, but to kind of really create an atmosphere and to create emotion? It's very difficult. So I designed a few things very subtly within the environment to kind of plant imagery into your mind and make you feel certain things. With this shipwreck on the beach, you can kind of, if you look at it from certain angles, you get this real... like a cross sticking up, it's a semi-religious imagery, but it's not obvious, it's not in your face, it's just kind of like... something that makes you feel like something you know. And there's a lot of deliberate attempts in the game to recreate that feeling. It's kind of hard to point out in many other places, but it's done in a way where every single rock, every single plant and every single cliff face have been deliberately placed and designed in a way to make you feel something in the game." />
  <text key="28" string="Jess: One of the really important images in the game is the radio mast. And the soundscapes that I wrote for the game are really tied into this idea, so it's the concept of the tortured sounds that are so broken down, so manipulated and it really is supposed to represent the inner state of the protagonist at this point. It's that fractured understanding so it kind of works on two levels, actually - we have the narrator who's trying to understand the journey that he's on, and we also have the audience's journey and their struggle for comprehension to understand what's going on in the game, so this distortion, this breaking down, this fragmented, tortured sound really ties in to the idea of the radio mast and that idea of communication, actually, that the game is trying to communicate something to you, the narrator is trying to tell you something but it's so difficult to understand what that is." />
  <text key="29" string="Dan: This is another of my favourite bits in the game where you come along the edge of the gully and you find hundreds of books, and it's one of the first times where, most explicitly, there's the suggestion that nothing you're seeing is real because there's no way that this can exist and it's this really amazing uncanny moment, but it works, I think, for me because you just go &quot;I don't understand it but it's lodged somewhere in my head and I can't get rid of it and I can't un-see this&quot;. And I think for me, like in terms of my influences from books, I mean there's the obvious sort of stuff like with burrows cut up and things like that going on, but it comes from the kind of books that I really love that, like &lt;i&gt;Roadside Picnic&lt;/i&gt;, or the other one by the Strugatskys that I absolutely love is &lt;i&gt;The Ugly Swans&lt;/i&gt;. They're just full of these images that you go &quot;I don't understand. I literally have no idea what's going on here, but I can't shake it... it's just got its hooks in me&quot;. And I think more recently you have books like Jeff VanderMeer's &lt;i&gt;Annihilation&lt;/i&gt; does this so well, where nothing's understandable, but you feel the logic but you can't understand the logic, but you feel like the logic's there. And that, I think, is a really powerful thing that games are so good at doing, of creating these things that I think... where a lot of game writing for me becomes... kind of, the wheels fall off it is that they have these amazing ideas and then suddenly there's this huge rush of &quot;we've developed this mythos, we've shown all the tips of the iceberg which are really interesting, but now we're going to show you the whole iceberg&quot;, and actually that's never that satisfactory as a player because it robs the mystery, and I think the best game writing is those... those kinds of moments where you go &quot;I feel there's something just outside the edge of my vision, just on the edge of my hearing&quot; but it's the confidence to go &quot;that's it. That's all you get&quot;, and the rest of it is up to your imagination. And I think it does loop back to games like &lt;i&gt;STALKER&lt;/i&gt;, I think. &lt;i&gt;Skyrim&lt;/i&gt; at its best does it so well, where you just have these moments where you think &quot;I want to know, but it's going to be down to my imagination to draw those things&quot;. And the player's imagination is the most powerful thing you've got in your design kit - there's nothing you can put on screen, there's nothing you can do with audio, there's nothing you can do with dialogue that will ever be as powerful as the player's own imagination, so if you oversell the idea and oversell the image, what you're actually doing is you're not only robbing the player of the opportunity to invest in the game, but you're also fundamentally opting for a weaker tool than what the player can bring to the experience themselves." />
  <text key="30" string="Rob: The caves in the game are really interesting because it's a very tonal shift within the whole visual look of the game. It's kind of like this more organic, more surreal dreamlike landscape compared to what you're used to before this point. We kind of used the visuals and this unreal theme very subtly, but here it's at the forefront and it's, to me, designed as a kind of journey through the inner self, through the body and it's really designed to be a different experience compared to the rest of the game." />
  <text key="31" string="Jess: This, for me, is probably the most pivotal music cue in the game and it's the one that most people write to me about to say they are absolutely obsessed with and they love. It's the only music cue that has singing, it has a female voice, I think that's a really important shift for me, that you've gone from this beautiful string music, but is quite abstract, into what is effectively a song with lyrics, so you're actually explicitly saying something as a composer at this point. The other thing that I think is important to say, for me, is the biggest shift from the music that I wrote for the mod is the same music, but the act of having it sung by an amazing singer. I sang it on the original and it's really bad, and Clara Sanabras re-recorded it and it's what good actors do, it's what Nigel Carrington did, it's what good musicians do when they take something you've created, and they just shove it up into the next level and make something that's good into something really extraordinary. And also for me, I think, it's a point where the environment art and the music just meld so beautifully and so seamlessly into one. On a personal level, I've played the game hundreds of times now and I still enter the caves and I look at Rob's work and I'm just absolutely overawed and gobsmacked by its beauty, and I just think it's a really magical moment in gaming for me, actually, and I know that probably sounds really dramatic but I just think it absolutely hits something where everything just works together. And the music is so dreamlike. Rob has talked about the journey through the body and I think that's absolutely, for me, the music becomes so organic and fluid and actually very feminine and female at that point. You're hearing the voice of his love. " />
  <text key="32" string="Dan: I just want to say that I think you can divide caves in games into pre- and post- &lt;i&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/i&gt;. I think it's a way of breaking away from reality into saying what you can do with these spaces that actually makes them these... incredibly much more vividly colourful and much more interpretative and, look for it, and it's really interesting that I kind of look at caves now in games and I find myself going &quot;that's a very Rob Briscoe cave&quot;. I think that's a really, an amazing thing to have achieved. I think it's one those... it's great paying other people's work compliments, I enjoy that because you never feel like you're being big-headed about yourself, but I think it is... I think particularly it does come again down to the blend between the audio and visuals that just... it's a real high watermark, I kind of... it's one of the areas in all the games we've made that I'm most proud of.&#xA;Jess: I think as well...you think you know what you're getting with &lt;i&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/i&gt; for the first 45 minutes of the game, wherever we are at this point and then you step into something completely unexpected and completely new, and I think it just throws the player such a curveball in such a wonderful way." />
  <text key="33" string="Dan: This is a bit more of a pretentious one because we disagree on this one. I struggle with this. The points in the caves where you duck above and below the water and you have to have that transition of audio, and I love the audio on both sides of the surface tension of the water, but I really struggle with you breaking water because there's such a hard edge to the sound, and I don't think there's any other way around that. And you need to have those moments where you do go underwater because it's so important, but it's one of the areas that never sat very comfortably with me, because I feel like in a level which hasn't got a single edge in it, it's the one edge within it and it breaks me.&#xA;Jess: And that's why I think it's so successful because you've been lured into this completely hallucinatory dreamlike world, and then all of a sudden, as a player you're literally gasping for breath, you're coming up for air and I think when we're talking about that metaphor of the body, for me, this is all... it's so about birth, and it's about this coming through the water and, actually, it's a moment of realisation for me, but then you having to go back down again and you're diving down so for me, without wanting to sound incredibly pretentious, it's about the fight between the conscious and the subconscious in that struggle. BOOYAH!&#xA;Rob: Ah, there's actually a really....&#xA;(Everyone laughs)&#xA;Rob: There's actually a really interesting thing about that underwater section there, though. I don't know if you remember but you had a certain piece of music that plays when you're underwater and, to me, I really liked that. It's kinda like 'cos at this point it's a very calm, relaxed journey and you go underwater and it starts to break apart a little bit. That kind of... psychosis is still there. It's not complete bliss at this point and it helps to build the atmosphere up to this final jump.&#xA;Jess: So we're both saying that Dan's wrong?&#xA;Rob: Yeah.&#xA;Dan: Excellent. That's good. That's the way it should be." />
  <text key="34" string="Dan: I think when you're designing a game, it's very easy to get very locked into what the system can do, and you're trying to deal with all the different variations of things that &quot;if a player does this, then this, and we have to deal with consequence here&quot;, and our lead designer Andrew and I talk about this all the time about you might have an idea, but then how does this radiate out throughout the entire system? You get very caught in the idea of what the system has to be and how robust the system has to be and this kind of thing. And what I think is really important as a designer, as a creative is that understanding that, actually, the real game is happening in the player's head and that the system can be whatever you want it to be, but if the game isn't running in the player's head as opposed to on the screen, then you're missing a trick, you're not letting the game be everything it could be. And I think the great thing about working with a game as simple as &lt;i&gt;Esther&lt;/i&gt;, in a way, is that those sort of consequences of player interaction - there's not a huge number of them in a way there might be with a very mechanically complex game. So you can heavily focus on what is the game experiences being played out within the player's mind and heart at the moment, and there are other, you know, sort of.... a way of approaching game design that has become increasingly popular over the last few years, like &lt;i&gt;Journey&lt;/i&gt; was a really, really good example of thatgamecompany really focusing on &quot;what's the emotional experience of playing this game?&quot; But I think, again, that's probably one of the reasons why &lt;i&gt;Esther&lt;/i&gt; has lasted as long as it has done, because it's not a mechanical exercise, it's an exercise in trying to inspire you, as a player, to have the deepest experience and the deepest engagement and to really run the game in your own head rather than be something that you... you know, you're sitting six feet away from, kind of, interacting with... I hate interaction as a term for that; I think it becomes very cold and mechanical and systems-driven, and really interaction is completely trivial and pointless if there isn't emotional engagement with the player and you haven't moved it away from the screen and into the player's head." />
  <text key="35" string="Jess: &lt;i&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/i&gt; was my first foray into writing music for games, and I actually approached it very traditionally, so more as a film score than a traditional, interactive game music score. And what's really interesting for me is that the lack of interactivity in the music was never a problem for anybody that played the game, and that's a separate discussion but there's a big schism between game music composers of how much the music should be following the player at all times in terms of interactive music, but one of the reasons I wanted to say something at this point was that this was my little first journey into thinking about how you write music for games rather than films, so I had this song that was a certain length and Dan said &quot;well, we don't know how long the player is going to take to traverse through that space&quot; and I thought &quot;oh no! He's right!&quot; and slightly panicked. So this was a very simple solution where the song was split in half and then I wrote some drone music that could just play for as long as was needed as the player walks through the space, and then the second half of the song would seamlessly play. And it's very, very simple, but it's quite emblematic for me in terms of my career because it was the first time I had to think about the player because, with film music, it's so simple: you know exactly what's going to happen and when, but this concept of interactivity was so new for me so I kinda look back at it fondly because it's quite a basic approach to... compared to something like &lt;i&gt;Everybody's Gone to the Rapture&lt;/i&gt;, where that was an open world adventure, I had to really think about the player and their movement through the space. I kinda look on this very fondly, this moment in the game." />
  <text key="36" string="Dan: I don't know when the paper origami boats first came into things with &lt;i&gt;Esther&lt;/i&gt;, really, but it felt like a really amazing metaphor of taking these letters and folding them into boats and then letting them leave the island because you kind of… you know, at this point in the game, this kind of realisation is there that this isn't going to end well, and that the narrator is never leaving the island, and the idea of communication, the attempt or failure of communication or trying to speak through the coma or whatever it is, or however you want to interpret it. But the idea of putting the boat in the underground river really felt like... it kinda reinforced that sort of dreamlike quality of the caves of... actually, there's something really sad about this one boat because when you see it go past, you know that even the boats aren't going to leave the island. Like this is something which doesn't have a tidy neat resolution and there's... even if you don't think about it to that level of depth, there's just something... it's one of those things that I really love about games that you can do where it's just a moment that has a really distinct, emotional tone to it that you go... there's a pause when you see that boat go past that I just think it is... it's something special you can do with media like games." />
  <text key="38" string="Dan: In a lot of ways, the caves were the hardest area of the game to actually write, because we knew we didn't want to have much voiceover in there. Because of the strength of the music - and this goes right back to the original mod - we wanted THAT to be the voice and for it to be a chance for Esther to speak rather than the narrator, and we also wanted to have this break, so when the narrator came out from the caves you had a real, definite sense of something happening, and that he changed as a result of this journey, so it meant... it really felt wrong to have a lot of voiceover within there, but that made it really difficult because then it was... it had like, 4 one-sentence lines in there, and each one of those had to have an absolute clarity and to really, really kind of work. So I think, for me, it was really interesting, because like the difference between writing fiction and writing poetry, when you read really amazing poets and you have that incredible, surgical precision where every single word is considered and placed so absolutely. And rather than being able to kind of... because the narrator rambles quite naturally, it was able to... you could kind of get into the flow of the narrator's ramble in other places in the level; and this was a real challenge because, suddenly, I was having to write like a poet of going - every single one of these words, every single cadence, every single sound has to be absolutely perfect, or it'll just feel like the narrator's voice is intruding on the rest of the experience. So it was, yeah, the most challenging area as a writer." />
  <text key="39a" string="Jess: The sound here is a classic case of, again, what music I think does really well, which is you have this soft, lyrical, beautiful, epic, dreamlike music, and then the moment you come out of the caves, you're into this really harsh soundscape and the tonal shift is very, very brutal, I think, and deliberately so. You have very little music when you come out of the caves. You hear the wind, and it's a classic case of foreshadowing so we know from this point that things are probably going to get bleaker, more difficult and yeah, it's something that music does really well, I think, which is that emotional signalling and signposting. " />
  <text key="40" string="Dan: This whole area moved, didn't it? The original mod, this was a cave...&#xA;Rob: Yeah.&#xA;Dan: Right at the beginning of the caves, where everything was written, and it moved to the backend of the level and we had this long corridor that was full of these kind of... it was the point of high madness, I think, in the game, isn't it?&#xA;Rob: Yeah, yeah, it's kind of just where you feel like you're losing the plot completely, both visually and auditory and, you know, it's kind of like, this really frenetic moment for me.&#xA;Dan: I think it's where you feel most that you're underneath a mountain, and you feel the weight of that mountain and just the... I loved the idea when we were, you know, putting through it of &quot;what would it actually take to do this?&quot; Like, to actually paint all of these symbols and what is going on, and it really... it's quite an explicit kind of thing of madness of going... you would have to be insane or very, very disturbed to actually do this and what is the process of this person trying to work through, what they are trying to achieve by this and I think it really strengthened it.... making it a crawl through a tunnel as opposed to just a static location.&#xA;Rob: Yeah, I think it's the consistency and the coherence of the symbols is a lot more broken down as well. Like, you see some symbols before, scattered around the environment, but at this point they're like right in your face and they're kind of just... it's just total madness. Any kind of meaning has been crossed over and confused and you know, I think it really helps to bring the tension up at this point in the level as well, so you're kind of coming out of a dreamlike state a little bit.&#xA;Dan: Yeah, you kind of know that you're getting towards the end of the serenity into something that's a bit more disturbed." />
  <text key="42" string="Dan: The motorway scene. The biggest new addition between the mod and the commercial version. This didn't exist in the mod at all. It was a completely new thing.&#xA;Rob: Yeah, it's a… I wasn't sure where the idea spawned from to have this. I just went off for a week, discussed it or... I can't remember.&#xA;Dan: I can't remember. Can you remember? It just kind of appeared, didn't it?&#xA;Rob: Yeah, it's... I think for me, actually, I remember it being some technical difficulty between the drop and then coming out at the end part, but it was like... it was the same thing that we dealt with in the past of &quot;how do we not kill the player?&quot; So, from a technical standpoint, I think it might have something to do with that, but it was also, you know... I can't remember where the whole thing came from.&#xA;Jess: I think it's my favourite point in the whole game, actually. I think it's just an absolutely... it's quite shocking, and it's so surreal, and it's so beautiful, and from an audio point of view you have that baby's heartbeat bringing us back to the idea of the ultrasound - was Esther pregnant? Again, it's one of those moments that I think everything just sort of collates together and it's so unexpected. &#xA;Rob: Yeah, for me, it's like a moment of realisation. It's like it's coming to terms with something, almost.&#xA;Dan: Whether or not what is going on at the moment is real, this was... this did happen as a kind of absolute. I remember playtesting it and I didn't know that the car can get switched out with the hospital gurney, and I must've played it, I was like 3 or 4 times into playtesting it, the first time it switched out and it was a gurney, I remember sitting there and going &quot;Oh God! That's just... MURHHH!&quot; I was just stopped in my tracks by it. It's one of those weird things you get when you're making a game that you know you'll never have that same... those moments that a player does, where you know it all so well, it's really, really rare to be in a situation where you actually get a genuine, fresh player's eye view on what you're making.&#xA;Rob: Yeah, I was always a bit worried that it was maybe a bit too literal... like we got a bit too literal with that, but I think looking back at it now, there's still a lot of strangeness going on there. Obviously the whole scene is unusual, but there's still these very subtle details that are there that are still making you think &quot;what does that mean?&quot; I think if you look closely, there's coins scattered around and things like that.&#xA;Jess: And for me, again, sorry to keep going on about it, but it's about layers of subconscious for me that you start over ground, you go into the caves, you go deeper, you're falling down... it's going down the rabbit hole, effectively, and then you go to the deepest level and that's actually the truth, that's the reality, that's what happened." />
  <text key="43" string="Dan: So the admission really is that, um, I did play fast and loose with the geography of the M5; there isn't actually a 'Welcome Break' services just outside the junction of Sandford…&#xA;Jess: As has been pointed to you!&#xA;Dan: But we also know, as has been pointed out, the players have... what a thing if you make something that's based vaguely on somewhere in real life. In terms of a compliment, when you're getting emails from players going &quot;there isn't a 'Welcome Break' there&quot; and people REALLY trying to work out &quot;where is this?&quot; and whole threads about where on the M5 it is. That's just the most amazing feeling, but I think... what I really love about, what I think works really, really well in &lt;i&gt;Esther&lt;/i&gt; and, again, I think it's something that I think is really carried forwards to other games is that a lot of the time we're not dealing with, kind of like, big, glamorous, amazing, epic places - it's a sort of ratty little island in the Hebrides, it's someone who lived in Wolverhampton, it's just outside, you know, a service station on a stretch of the M5, and I think that earths it, it earths what's going on... it gives it a realness as well, particularly when you sort of put it against the surreal-ness of the caves. That's you kinda going &quot;this is really surreal and this is really, really dreamlike, but actually I'm talking about a car accident just outside a 'Little Chef'&quot; but it kind of... that playing off those two things against each together.&#xA;Rob: It's like making the ordinary extraordinary.&#xA;Dan: Absolutely, yeah." />
  <text key="44" string="Rob: This scene, to me, is really, really iconic because it kind of brings this idea of the caves being this inward journey through the body together. It's really like a symbol of rebirth, and actually brings together a lot of the visual goals that I wanted to achieve with a lot of the symbolism in the game. I've talked a little bit about how the environment was kind of designed to provoke emotions, and the impressionistic style gives you just enough information to make you think of things and feel things, but this is like... this is probably like the antithesis of this, and the whole feeling of rebirth here is quite strong. I know Jess...&#xA;Jess: Yeah, the music's really supporting that, because we've gone... she sings &quot;always, always&quot; throughout, you know, you've got &quot;always, always&quot;, and then she sings &quot;never&quot; and the moment of absolute soaring, it's the climax of the music.&#xA;Rob: Yeah, as you come out of the water and the music kind of swells and you just kind of... it is like... a moment of change has happened in some way.&#xA;Jess: Its rebirth, isn't it? For me it's his moment of clarity and acceptance and understanding of the reality of what's happened.&#xA;Dan: And you're literally moving towards the light at the end of the tunnel.&#xA;Jess: Yes.&#xA;Dan: You're actually doing that as you go through.&#xA;Rob: But the music especially, I think, before the music got layered in, that scene was nowhere near as powerful for me. I think that totally made it." />
  <text key="45" string="Jess: Dan and I had worked on lots of projects together, non-game projects, before we made &lt;i&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/i&gt;. And I think the thing that links all of the projects that we've worked on together is that idea of hidden stories and layers of stories, and one of the things I wanted to do with the music was to embed hidden little hints and stories into it, so the music that you hear here has Morse code, and the Morse code is spelling out the word 'Esther' and I really, really liked this concept that some people would understand that it was Morse code and trying to figure out what it was saying. It also provided a really interesting rhythmical dynamic, and yeah, it's just about these ideas of hidden stories and layers, but it also starts to emphasise the obsessional nature, I think, of the story in &lt;i&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/i&gt; and his agitation and actually slight panic, so you're getting this rhythm that just repeats and repeats and repeats obsessively. So I think, even if you don't understand that it's saying 'Esther', and even if you don't understand that it's Morse code, you're still getting this feeling of this obsessional repetition and slight panic that he has. Again, it's kind of, it's a new chapter and it's spelling out that something has changed at this point." />
  <text key="46" string="Dan: This is probably the level which has changed most from the original mod, I think, it’s much, much bigger than the final level in the mod. One of the major changes in there is that, in the original mod, the whole side of the cliff face was covered in painting and writing, and a lot of that moved inside to that corridor in the caves where it's really obsessionally painted on. And it was really.... we spent so long on that because we trying to get it looking right, because I really... it's one of those really interesting examples where I loved the image and the idea that you've got this guy painting the entire side of the mountain with words and symbols and things, but it was really interesting when it went into the rebuild, it just never worked and I think it was because the environments were so crude in the mod that those symbols and that painting became the focus of the level, and it changed the feeling of the level completely when, actually, that just wasn't something we could realise in any way, not even technically, but just didn't artistically look and feel right. And I think probably... sort of retrospectively looking back on it, that's about the sophistication and the subtlety that then came into the art rather than just being &quot;this is literally just a canvas that we write words on&quot; to actually the environment telling its own story without the story being literally painted on it.&#xA;Rob: Yeah, it was... it was very difficult when we were experimenting with that to make it not completely unreal. I think, for me, it was... I wanted to kind of bring the player a little bit back into reality after the caves, and I think having those symbols everywhere it was kind of pushing them out a little bit. So I think what we came to with the compromise we had, it was kind of a nice in-between.&#xA;Dan: It didn't feel like a compromise to me. It didn't work, but it kind of... those symbols were coded like there's the hill in the background when you're standing right to the end near the boats and you look back and you suddenly realise the shape of the mountain is the shape of a woman lying on her side asleep, and that, I remember seeing for the first time around and going &quot;it's saying the same things, but it's saying it in a much, much, much subtler way than in the initial layout&quot; but it was definitely challenging going back to &quot;how do you have a deep, complicated, subtle art style but still manage to have something which is stark and symbolic layered over the top?&quot; It was much more challenging." />
  <text key="47" string="Jess: I've been on holiday to Greece lots of times and one of the things that I always really responded to emotionally was those shrines that you see on the road, and sometimes they're dedicated to saints and sometimes they're to mark where an accident has taken place, so you'll get photos of the deceased person and flowers and candles. And they'd always really touched me, so I said to Rob &quot;I think it'll be amazing to get these into the game somehow&quot;, and then Rob took the idea and ran with it, and I think they're so successful and they're so beautiful and they're really moving, and I think it's because you had this elemental scale - you have the island and it's huge and you have that scale, and all of a sudden, you come around this corner and it's absolutely brought back to the human scale again and to that relationship of the individual. And I think the other thing that it does really successfully is it's a kind of magic realism because there's no way that you could have all those amounts of candles lighting your way - who's lit them? The island is empty, who's put those shrines there? But I think it's a really lovely bit of environmental storytelling, actually." />
  <text key="48" string="Dan: One of the really nice things about the move from the mod to the commercial version is that we had a couple of years' worth of the community talking about the game before we went back into it again and one of the things that I read in the forum was that someone had constructed this amazing version of the story, where they had decided that the narrator was Paul. And I hadn't thought of that. It was never part of the original writing. And I thought &quot;that's so amazing&quot; that, as a writer, your audience can find something in what you're doing that you hadn't thought of, so it's really important when we went back in to record the additional set of voiceovers, I thought &quot;I absolutely want to do it so I want to take this idea that's come out of the fans and to run with this entire new stream of story in there&quot;. So we added in a couple of cues within the 4th level that intimated much more strongly that, actually, Paul wasn't this other character who caused the accident but actually, you were responsible for everything. But again, it was trying to find that balance of not overcooking it so you weren't led to that idea, but just if you happened to have the combination of just a couple of narrative units, then you would possibly come to that interpretation, but it was really amazing to be able to say... It felt like giving something back to the fans that had enabled us to make the remake in the first place, and it's always a lovely moment as a developer to be able to recognise your fan community and kind of say &quot;thanks. This one's yours. This one's here for you.&quot;" />
  <text key="50" string="Dan: The last level ended up being quite a lot bigger than the original mod, and it's also the one where, actually, the movement around it is in a way the most artificial; there's the big zig-zagging cliff paths that basically is like a series of straight lines from point to point, there isn't a lot of movement, and one of the things that was really difficult to do with that was to not make it feel too much like a corridor, and to give it that sort of sense of space and that you WERE actually exploring somewhere quite natural. Um, I think Rob, there was stuff which you put in there like little new, beat moments like the ruins at the edge of the cliff...&#xA;Rob: Yeah.&#xA;Dan: ... That just helped the player feel like they're on a journey, rather than being pushed through a pipe.&#xA;Rob: Yeah, it was kind of just giving the player the reward for continuing on and, you know, still giving them some aspect of exploration and things to discover. I mean, the journey in this one is mostly vertical. But, in the spaces where you are going horizontally, at least in the original mod, there wasn't a lot to see or do, so I just tried layering in some very subtle things - things that didn't necessarily add huge arcs to the story, but just kind of added little questions. More than anything else, I added the dock at the end. There's lots of little bits and pieces that have been layered in, to really just make it a lot more of an interesting place despite the size." />
  <text key="51" string="Jess: What's fascinating to me, Dan, is that you're an atheist, but each of the three games that we've made are so strongly about religion, either the language or taking allegories in stories. Why are you so drawn to it?&#xA;Dan: I think I'm really interested in people and the stories that make up people, and I think there is a... like in the Bible, like in most kind of religious texts, it's not about what it is, it's about what is behind what it is, and that's what you're really getting towards - the idea of the parable or the metaphor. And it really felt like, particularly with Paul on the road to Damascus, is a story that many, many, many people know and we can understand and it's about redemption and consequence and guilt and transformation and who you really are and what that means. And it felt like just a really strong, powerful way of making it very accessible - the narrator's inner turmoil - in a kind of story that we know really well, and there's a universality to those kind of questions that, you know, whether it's with Christianity, whether it's with Islam, whether it's Buddhism that they're asking very broadly similar questions - &quot;what does it mean to be human?&quot;, &quot;what does it mean to be a good person?&quot;, &quot;how should we behave to each other?&quot;, &quot;how should we feel about the world we're in?&quot; - and it's a really powerful way of speaking to a lot of people. I think that's what's really important as well is that it's about saying: no matter who you are or what your kind of outlook on life is, whether that's faith-based or secular, that we are all effectively asking the same questions. And that's why I think all our games kind of tend to be around those questions." />
  <text key="52" string="Dan: Is &lt;i&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/i&gt; a depressing game or a hopeful game?&#xA;Rob: For me it's kind of a mix of both, really. I think, my interpretation is like... I always feel kind of depressed when I think about the kind of turmoil that this guy has been going through, for God knows how long, and the kind of environment he's been in, and then all these events surrounding his story, but for me I always feel a little bit hopeful at the end... like, the conclusion, it feels like a relief and this has kind of all ended in some way. What do you think, Jess?&#xA;Jess: I think it's a game about acceptance, and I really like that and I think it's telling that a lot of people with mental health issues have responded really positively to the game and we get a lot of emails and letters from those people saying that it's helped them through a really difficult time. And, for me, that's because it's about the struggle of being human - that it's hard, and that we love, and that we grieve, and we lose, but we come through it, and those things are what makes us human, that it's transformative and that the pain is a part of life, and that's a really beautiful message. And I think that's what you do so well, Dan, and that's what you write about; you write about what it is to be human.&#xA;Jess: So Dan, you wrote it.&#xA;Dan: (laughs) Without wanting to cop out, one of the things about writing it that I really wanted to do was to make something that people could take and own, and it would be their take on it. And their interpretation of it mattered, in a way that mine didn't. My job was to give them the architecture to interpret in their way.&#xA;Jess: I think that IS a cop-out. I do. I think, as a writer, you always have...&#xA;Dan: Yeah, I think it's redemptive, but I don't think the redemption is as cut-and-dried and &quot;it's all OK at the end&quot;. It's not OK at the end; but there's a release, there's an escape. Bad times will happen but they will end... and they won't always end positively but they will end, and that's the.. I think, the redemption of it, of saying that things are never easy...&#xA;Jess: &quot;This, too, shall pass,&quot; as my mum always says.&#xA;Dan: This too shall pass, yeah.&#xA;Jess: And I think that's probably the motto of The Chinese Room, actually, isn't it?&#xA;Dan: Yeah, absolutely! Like, I don't think it's as... as openly positive as, say... &lt;i&gt;Rapture&lt;/i&gt; had a much more strongly, positive end, that I don't think &lt;i&gt;Esther&lt;/i&gt; has; I think it's much greyer than that. But I think that, fundamentally, it's about coming to terms." />
  <text key="52a" string="NOT USED" />
  <text key="53" string="Dan: So &lt;i&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/i&gt; is the first 'walking simulator'. How do you feel about 'walking simulator'?&#xA;Rob: I think I took offense to it when it first became a thing. But I think, actually, I don't mind it so much now. I think the fact that we have taken ownership over it, like that genre has been... made our own, by not just our game but like a bunch of different games that kind of embraced it. What do you guys think?&#xA;Jess: I'm still really confused about the need to categorise in games probably more than any other creative industry, and I think it shows that games have a long way to come in terms of how we describe and experience, so I do agree with Rob that it's really positive that we reclaimed 'walking simulator', but I still find it reductive, possibly, as a term. What about you, Dan?&#xA;Dan: I think, for me, people want to know what they're buying and what they're getting into, and I think it's so... people understand what a walking simulator is now, in a way that if it was a 'first-person adventure' or 'slow-moving, not very interactive, story driven games'. They're all sort of really very fluffy, but I think if you buy a game and someone says it's a walking simulator now, you've got a pretty good idea of what you're getting, and there's been.... there's &lt;i&gt;Gone Home&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Firewatch&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Stanley Parable&lt;/i&gt;, there's so many other really good titles that fall within that group of games out there now, that it does have an identity. And I think that's the really good thing about it. I think when &lt;i&gt;Esther&lt;/i&gt; came out, there was literally nothing; we had no idea how we described it or what we called it.&#xA;Rob: We actually struggled with that quite a lot...&#xA;Dan: Yeah, and it sort of ended up being a 'ghost story' since it felt the closest thing we could get, but it feels like now you could make a game like this and you could say &quot;it's a walking simulator&quot; and people would know what it is straight away.&#xA;Rob: Yeah, I think that's the nice thing is that there's a whole group of games out there now that, quite comfortably, put themselves into that category so if we were to come out before and just said &quot;it's a walking simulator&quot;, people would have been like &quot;well, that sounds terribly boring. Why the hell would I play that?&quot;, but now people kind of...&#xA;Jess: ... seek them out.&#xA;Rob: Yeah, now people are kind of familiar with what that means. There are people out there who actually seek this sort of stuff out. It's really cool. I mean, me, myself, I would actually do that... use that as a term to search. Yeah, I mean... it's a very simplified term for what our game is. And there's obviously a lot more to it than walking, but I think when you look at other genres that they are also very simplified: first-person shooter, role-playing game... it's, to me, doesn't seem as bad as any of those other things. " />
  <text key="54" string="Dan: There's a bit of an illusion of simplicity with games like &lt;i&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/i&gt; that people kind of assume, because there's not a lot of mechanics, there's not much going on in that sense, that they're easy to make. I think it's actually kind of the opposite in a way that because they're so simple, everything is exposed, and everything has to be exceptionally good for it to work because you are... you're carrying a player's experience on a fairly sparse, minimal kind of framework, and that really means that every aspect of it has to be produced at a really high quality, and it has to be done with a lot of passion and a lot of thought. There's nowhere to hide in a game like &lt;i&gt;Esther&lt;/i&gt; and that's something which I think carries through to the best games of this type; you can see, with all of them, there's a real commitment to kind of depth and a really intelligent way of approaching design. And a real kind of trust in the player and a real assumption that players are smart, imaginative people who want experiences. There's no... it's not a game that's easy to just knock off or to do with any kind of lazy attitude, you have to be really, really passionate and care a great deal and put an awful lot of thought into it if it's going to work." />
  <text key="55" string="Rob: One of the things that I think was added more frequently in the final version of &lt;i&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/i&gt; was the inclusion of a number of ghosts in the game. These are not like ghosts that you'd see in a normal horror game, they're just very loose silhouettes that you'll see around the island, usually quite a distance off, or just kind of somewhere that you'd barely see out the corner of your eye, and I think this is a good example of where it's kind of really in-your-face; and these are kind of something that we put in to, not just bring some unreal elements to the island, but something supernatural as well. Something that's kind of beyond this world, something kind of unsettling. Yeah, a lot of effort's been put in to make these things very subtle, I didn't really want them to be like... I didn't want it to be a 'ghost' story so to speak. But I just wanted to bring some of this supernatural element into the game, and this area is probably one of the most prominent because you can see it just before you go down into the gully here, and I think it's really one of my favourite scenes just because of it being so spooky, so unreal and so interesting." />
  <text key="56" string="Dan: The overlook. The point about this, to me, is probably the voiceover in the game that kind of sums up the whole story and experience; it's almost like a recap of everything that's gone before, before you start the final climb. And you know it's that pause before you're gonna start the final climb, and before the game builds to a climax. You can also see the whole level and it's like the idea that you are standing, looking down on your own journey. A bit like the idea of your life flashing before your eyes, or sort of like seeing your body but having an out-of-body experience at the moment of death, and it was really designed to try and get that feeling as the player that you stop, and you take stock of everything, and there's a bit of a sense of &quot;there's no going back, you take a breath, and now it finishes&quot;; and I really wanted to achieve that sort of sense and I think we did. I think it really came together here that you got that sense of going &quot;right, now this ends and now I move forward to it&quot;." />
  <text key="57" string="Rob: So here it kind of… the environment becomes a little bit more surreal again. We play with the colours a little bit, we bring up the saturation, it's a little bit of a return to some of the more cave-like aesthetics in terms of colours and stuff like that. It's kind of there to signpost another significant moment in the game or something that's leading up to the significant moment. It goes back to this kind of idea of having these emotional signposts in the visuals without being overly obvious, and some of that emotional stuff comes through... just through the colours of the environment and, the more saturated they are, the more surreal things become. So this is kind of like a turning point in the game, it's kind of like the final notice of you reaching the end." />
  <text key="58" string="Jess: The music that's playing here is a repeat of another cue, and originally we hear it played on the piano, and the string quartet take on the piece here. And it's one of those really nice instances where we're in the studio and I had this idea of how it was going to sound, and I thought it was going to be quite full and rich and... full-bodied, and one of the string players said to me &quot;this is wrong, actually, for what we're playing&quot; and they said &quot;let's strip out all the vibrato. Let's play it in a really Scottish, plain style&quot; and it absolutely transformed that piece and it's one of those really special things about being a composer is that you get to collaborate with people who come fresh to it, so you have this preconceived idea of how it should be, and then they say &quot;no, why don't we turn it around and think about it like this&quot; and it absolutely fits and works for that scene because what we're getting at this point is a sense of fragility, of an ending, and it's almost reminiscent of a funeral procession; it's slow and it's dirge-like. But yeah, it was just a lovely moment where they gave something of themselves, and that's what's amazing about working with live instrumentalists. You're never going to get that from a sample." />
  <text key="59" string="Dan: It was possible that this last section of the game could have felt quite laborious and forced because it's two long, zig-zagging paths that just go up and there was a real importance to getting it right, and quite a lot of work went into it. I think at this point, for me... You probably, as a player, understand that the narrator is going to die at the end and that this is it. Unlike where the rest of the island, there's this sense that this could just keep and keep going on forever and ever and ever, and the motif of 'come back, come back', but I think when you set on this path, we really wanted to have that sense of &quot;this is it. This is the last time you're going to walk these paths. This will end now&quot;; and that sort of idea of going... You're kind of climbing towards your death, but you're also moving towards a point where that glimpse in the caves where you see the motorway and you go &quot;I understand what this is about&quot;. For me, the whole path up the side of the mountain is about saying &quot;it's OK&quot;. It's that kind of starting to release it and go &quot;it's kind of OK that Esther died, it's kind of OK that the accident happened. I know I am going to die. I know that this is going to end; and I know there's nowhere for me to go but to follow this path, but that's alright.&quot; And really, it was really hard trying to find that subtle mix between the dread of it and the acceptance; it's where the positive and the negative and the loss and the redemption really start colliding for me. At least, certainly, that's what we were trying to achieve with it." />
  <text key="60" string="Rob: With the climb being quite a poignant moment of the game, overall, and of the story, it was quite a difficult task to try and make that climb still interesting and not too laborious, because there's kind of this zig-zag up there with nothing really… there's no real environment. You just have the sea on one side and the cliff face on the other, so there was quite a lot of work that went into building up this feeling of tension as you're rising, and making this moment as poignant as possible, whilst still making it interesting. So a lot of effort was put into building up this weather, building up the wind and the swaying of the grass and the volume of the soundscapes and everything mixing together with the music, and just kind of... visually, really try to make this a tense moment. And I think it's hopefully been pulled off alright. And you'll notice when you get to the top this kind of tension dies, and that's very purposeful: you'll see no more wind, it's just like a symbolic thing where you're coming to the last moment - the point of no return. That's been very deliberately designed that way." />
  <text key="61a" string="Jess: We had a lot of debates, didn't we, about the ending of the game and whether the player should retain control, or whether it was OK to go to a cutscene at this point. I personally don't mind it, I actually actively like it, because I think it works really well as a metaphor for loss of control at that point. Dan, I know you're not as keen.&#xA;Dan: Yeah, I'm not. I would have loved the player not to have had control taken away from them, but to me it was kind of a... it was a balance between two evils: the evil of having a cutscene and the evil of the player accidentally falling off the ladder halfway up and destroying the ending.&#xA;Rob: Yeah, I agree. We tried... I think we tried a few different things. The tech at the time was... the ladder tech at the time just wasn't there so... and the other thing for me was pacing. It was making sure all the music, the voiceovers, the timings and everything were perfect for that final jump-off point, and just letting the players kind of... noodle around, going up a ladder for what may have been, like, 7 minutes, 'cos it's a tall tower, was kind of an impossible task." />
  <text key="62" string="Jess: One of the things that I enjoyed the most on working on &lt;i&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/i&gt; was Rob's beautiful visuals were so inspiring, but Dan's words were always so amazing to write to. I think that's where we start as a partnership, and the music at the end was so easy to write because that last voiceover... it's the pinnacle of the writing to me, as it should be because it's the last VO! So you would've failed if it wasn't good, but it is just so beautiful and moving and, for me... talking about whether it's a hopeful ending, the music is really hopeful at this point and it's really... it signifies, to me: transformation, freedom, escape, acceptance... Yeah, it was just a beautiful cue to write, actually.&#xA;Dan: I don't know... can't remember quite where it came from in the mod, but the moment when we went &quot;or we could put the bird in there and you can see the bird's shadow&quot;, and actually it turned from being a straightforward, literal suicide into a metaphorical or, to my mind, kind of like, I always really believed that the narrator did turn into a bird just before they hit the ground, and that was really important. I think it's probably the strongest ending in any of our games so far, but yeah I'm very proud of the way everything came together in that last section.&#xA;Rob: Yeah, I think the bird thing is particularly interesting because I think it was in the original mod but the timings and everything were all...&#xA;Jess: Yeah.&#xA;Rob: ... off and you never really saw the seagull... at least the shadow as well, it was all kind of... a little bit broken, and I remember when we went back in, I made a real effort to try and get that shadow just out of the centre of the view, so you kind of... have this hint of something happening and I think you can hear the sound of a seagull flapping its wings, it's very subtle. But, like I say, I really like the way that came together... It's kind of a release but, at the same time, there's still this kind of ambiguity there... it's kind of beautiful.&#xA;Jess: And I'm really proud that I got the monitor in at the end for an ending of, you know, goes into the hospital monitor signifying the flatline and I think it's a really... it's one of those moments where you never want to be so clever that people notice it and takes them out of the moment, but It just flows in through the music, and it feels like everything comes together at that last point - that last VO, Rob's amazing visuals and the music, yeah, it feels like a really, really strong and beautiful ending.&#xA;Dan: And then in the last second, Nigel Carrington's delivery of just those 2 words, &quot;come back&quot;, where he's just... pitch perfect." />
  <text key="63" string="Jess: I think one of the most fascinating things, for me, about planning this directors' commentary has been, that in previous years, when all the three of us have talked about &lt;i&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/i&gt;, we've talked about the interpretation of the player, but actually going through this together post-having made it, we're still surprising each other, and I think that's really, really interesting for me because it shows that we left interpretation for each other and that we trusted each other, actually, just to get on with it, and because we each brought our own special and unique contribution to the game, we didn't have to, in a way, talk it to death or say &quot;you have to justify every idea you have or talk it to death or explain it&quot;... that Rob's idea that the island is very tainted and corrupt, and my idea - that Dan didn't know - that the whole level of the caves is a birth metaphor. I think it's really amazing that we're still finding out things about the game that we didn't know.&#xA;Rob: It was nice when I came onto it because Dan was basically, like, he gave me a bunch of materials, but he left me to my own devices for a lot of it, and we kind of like... I finished a level and Dan would play it and give me some feedback, but he was very hands-off at the beginning, which was really nice, you know, so a lot of my interpretations just came through that downtime, where I was just kind of going off and doing my own thing and... So yeah, it was interesting to hear Dan talk about it sometimes, because there's some backstory that I've never even considered before, and obviously, hearing Jess talk about it as well is really interesting, especially when it came to the soundtrack. It makes me look at things in a very different way, so yeah, it's really interesting.&#xA;Dan: I think, for me, making games is so inherently collaborative and you have people coming together with different ideas and different takes on things, and in a way the least interesting thing you can do with that is to structure it all so heavily that there's no space for each individual person to bring what they're thinking to it. And I think the best games, for me, my favourite games are ones where you can really feel the personal footprint of each individual developer and aspects of it, and it feels like it has been a genuinely collaborative exercise, where everybody has thrown ideas into the mix, and everybody is bringing something to the table rather than people just following a kind of really structured plan so... yeah, I think it's probably one of the reasons why &lt;i&gt;Esther&lt;/i&gt; has had the sort of life it's had since release is because there is... there's three people, four if you include Nigel, all bringing very different things to it and it gives it a very... a huge amount of depth for something that's so simple on the surface. " />
  <text key="64" string="Dan: What's really important to me is that &lt;i&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/i&gt; started out as &lt;i&gt;Half-Life 2&lt;/i&gt; mod, and if the &lt;i&gt;Half-Life 2&lt;/i&gt; modding community hadn't championed it, and celebrated it, and downloaded it a lot, and talked about it, and loved it, then it would never have been a game so it's never really bothered me - the &quot;is it a game?&quot; conversation - because as far as I can see it, &lt;i&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/i&gt; and everything that's come after it has been inspired by it. This was championed by &lt;i&gt;Half-Life 2&lt;/i&gt; modders and they made it what it is, and so if you've... if you've made something that the real hardcore of the hardcore, in terms of these first-person shooter modders, have gone &quot;this is really good and really special and we're behind this&quot;, then you've already got the support of a really amazing gaming community, and the fact that they championed it... We owe them a huge amount in terms of where we are, and I'm really proud to come out of that scene. I'm really proud to be a company and to be sitting here talking about a game that started life as a mod.&#xA;Rob: Yeah, I think they're the ones that have really pushed us forward, and given us the passion to be able to take it to a commercial level, and given us the confidence to make us believe that there is an audience for this kind of thing." />
  <text key="65" string="Jess: So that's the end of the directors' commentary. We'd just like to say a big 'thank you' to everyone for listening. We hope you've uncovered some secrets and some facts that you didn't know about the game before.&#xA;Dan: We also like to say a huge 'thank you' for buying the game and for all our fans who've been behind us and been behind the game and kept it alive all these years. It's a real privilege that it's still out there, still such a title that people love so much.&#xA;Rob: Yeah, and we're really looking forward to the future and what we can create... coming up next. Thanks for listening.&#xA;Jess: Cheers!&#xA;Dan: Bye." />
